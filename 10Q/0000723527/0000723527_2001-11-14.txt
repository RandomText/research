                         WORLDCOM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(A) GENERAL

The financial statements included herein, are unaudited and have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
for interim financial reporting and SEC regulations. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the
opinion of our management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (of
a normal and recurring nature) which are necessary to present fairly the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim
periods. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our
Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2000. The results
for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2001 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2001.

(B) RECAPITALIZATION

On June 7, 2001, our shareholders approved a recapitalization involving the
creation of two separately traded tracking stocks:

      o     WorldCom group stock, which is intended to reflect the performance
            of our data, Internet, international and commercial voice businesses
            and is quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
            "WCOM", and

      o     MCI group stock, which is intended to reflect the performance of our
            consumer, small business, wholesale long distance voice and data,
            wireless messaging and dial-up Internet access businesses and is
            quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
            "MCIT".

In connection with the recapitalization, we amended our articles of
incorporation to replace our existing common stock with two new series of common
stock that are intended to reflect, or track, the performance of the businesses
attributed to the WorldCom group and the MCI group. Effective with the
recapitalization on June 7, 2001, each share of our existing common stock was
changed into one share of WorldCom group stock and 1/25 of a share of MCI group
stock.

A tracking stock is a separate class of a company's common stock intended to
provide a return to investors based upon the financial performance of a distinct
business unit of the company, sometimes referred to as the targeted business.
These targeted businesses are collections of businesses that we have grouped
together in order for us to issue WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock. The
ownership of the targeted business does not change, and while each of the
classes of stock trade separately, all shareholders are common shareholders of a
single company, WorldCom, and are subject to all risks of an investment in
WorldCom as a whole.

During the second quarter of 2001, we declared the first quarterly dividend for
the MCI group common stock. A cash dividend of $0.60 per share of MCI group
common stock, or approximately $70 million in the aggregate, was paid on October
15, 2001 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 28,
2001. During the third quarter of 2001, we declared the fourth quarter dividend
of $0.60 per share of MCI group common stock to be paid on January 15, 2002 to
shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2001.

The MCI group was initially allocated notional debt of $6 billion and our
remaining debt was allocated on a notional basis to the WorldCom group. We
intend, for so long as the WorldCom group stock and the MCI group stock remains
outstanding, to include in filings by WorldCom under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, the combined financial statements of each of the WorldCom
group and the MCI group. These combined financial statements will be prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
and in the case of annual financial statements, will be audited. These combined
financial statements are not legally required under current law or SEC
regulations.


                                       6
<Page>

Voting rights of the holders of the WorldCom group stock and the MCI group stock
are prorated based on the relative market values of WorldCom group stock and MCI
group stock. We will conduct shareholder meetings that encompass all holders of
voting stock. The WorldCom group and the MCI group shareholders will vote
together as a single class on all matters brought to a vote of shareholders,
including the election of our directors.

Our board of directors may at any time convert each outstanding share of MCI
group stock into shares of WorldCom group stock at 110% of the relative trading
value of MCI group stock for the 20 days prior to the announcement of the
conversion. No premium will be paid on a conversion that occurs three years
after the issuance of MCI group stock.

If all or substantially all of the WorldCom group or MCI group assets are sold,
either: (i) the relevant shareholders will receive a distribution equal to the
fair value of the net proceeds of the sale, either by special dividend or by
redemption of shares; or (ii) each outstanding share of MCI group stock will be
converted into shares of WorldCom group stock at 110% or 100% of the relative
trading value of MCI group stock for a 10 trading day period following the sale.

(C) EMBRATEL DECONSOLIDATION

During the second quarter of 2001, we reached a long-term strategic decision to
restructure our investment in Embratel Participacoes S.A., or Embratel. The
restructuring included the resignation of certain Embratel Board of Directors
seats, the irrevocable obligation to vote a portion of our common shares in a
specified manner and the transfer of certain economic rights associated with
such shares to an unrelated third party. Based on these actions, the accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States prohibit the continued
consolidation of Embratel's results. Accordingly, we have deconsolidated
Embratel's results effective January 1, 2001.

(D) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On July 1, 2001, we acquired Intermedia Communications Inc. for approximately
$5.8 billion, including assumed long-term debt, pursuant to the merger of a
wholly owned subsidiary with and into Intermedia, with Intermedia continuing as
the surviving corporation and as a subsidiary of WorldCom. As a result of the
Intermedia merger, we acquired a controlling interest in Digex, Incorporated, or
Digex, a provider of managed Web and application hosting services for some of
the world's fastest growing companies. In connection with the Intermedia merger,
stockholders of Intermedia received one share of WorldCom group common stock (or
57.1 million WorldCom group shares in the aggregate) and 1/25th of a share of
MCI group common stock (or 2.3 million MCI group shares in the aggregate) for
each share of Intermedia common stock they owned. Holders of Intermedia
preferred stock, other than Intermedia's 13.5% Series B Redeemable Exchangeable
Preferred Stock due 2009, or Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock, received one
share of a class or series of our preferred stock, with substantially identical
terms, which were established upon consummation of the Intermedia merger. As a
result of the merger with Intermedia, we own approximately 90% of the voting
securities of Intermedia.

Upon effectiveness of the merger with Intermedia, the then outstanding and
unexercised options for shares of Intermedia common stock were converted into
options exercisable for an aggregate of approximately 10 million shares of
WorldCom group common stock having the same terms and conditions as the
Intermedia options, except that the exercise price and the number of shares
issuable upon exercise were divided and multiplied, respectively, by 1.0319. The
merger with Intermedia was accounted for as a purchase and was allocated to the
WorldCom group.

The purchase price in the Intermedia merger was allocated based on appraised
fair values at the date of acquisition. This resulted in an excess purchase
price over net assets acquired of $5.1 billion of which $67 million was
allocated to customer lists, which will be amortized over approximately four
years on a straight line basis. The remaining excess of $5.0 billion has been
allocated to goodwill and tradename which are not subject to amortization and
the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In connection with the Intermedia merger, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice is requiring us to dispose of Intermedia's Internet
service provider business, which provides integrated Internet connectivity
solutions. In addition to this required divestiture, we have also committed to a
plan to sell Intermedia's Advanced Building Network business, which provides
centralized telecommunications services in multi-tenant commercial office
buildings, and the systems integration business through which Intermedia sells,
installs, operates and maintains business telephony customer premise equipment
for its customers. We included the appraised fair values of these


                                       7
<Page>

assets to be disposed of in our initial allocation of the Intermedia purchase
price and also included accrued anticipated losses expected to be incurred
through disposal date. Any difference between the actual results of operations
and the amounts accrued will result in an adjustment of goodwill unless there is
a difference resulting from a post-merger event. For the three months ended
September 30, 2001, operating losses for these assets to be disposed of were
approximately $25 million, before corporate allocations. We anticipate that we
will complete these planned disposals within the next twelve months.

Since the Intermedia merger, WorldCom initiated plans to improve cash flow and
operating results by reorganizing and restructuring Intermedia's operations.
These plans include workforce reductions and other administrative cost savings,
the discontinuance of all product lines with unacceptable or negative margins
and the ultimate disposal of all assets associated with such product lines or
businesses.

(E) EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our consolidated financial statements present basic and diluted earnings per
share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock using the two-class method.
The two-class method is an earnings formula that determines the attributed
earnings per share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock according to
participation rights in undistributed earnings. The combined financial
statements of the WorldCom group and the MCI group do not separately present
earnings per share because WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock are series
of our common stock, and the WorldCom group and the MCI group are not legal
entities with a capital structure.

For purposes of our consolidated financial statements, basic earnings per share
attributed to WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock is computed by dividing
the respective attributed net income for the period by the respective number of
weighted-average shares of WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock then
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share attributed to WorldCom group stock and
MCI group stock is computed by dividing the respective attributed net income for
the period by the respective weighted-average number of shares of WorldCom group
stock and MCI group stock outstanding, including the respective dilutive effect
of WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock equivalents.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the
basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the WorldCom group and the
MCI group for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 2001 (in
millions, except share and per share data):

(H) SEGMENT INFORMATION

Based on our organizational structure, we operate in six reportable segments:
Commercial voice, data and Internet; International operations; Consumer;
Wholesale; Alternative channels and small business; and Dial-up Internet. Our
reportable segments represent business units that primarily offer similar
products and services; however, the business units are managed separately due to
the type and class of customer as well as the geographic dispersion of their
operations. The Commercial voice, data and Internet segment includes voice, data
and other types of domestic communications services for commercial customers,
and Internet services including dedicated access and web and application hosting
services. International operations provide voice, data, Internet and other
similar types of communications services to customers primarily in Europe and
the Asia Pacific region. Consumer includes domestic voice communications
services for consumer customers. Wholesale includes long distance voice and data
domestic communications services for wholesale customers. Alternative channels
and small business includes domestic long distance voice and data, agents,
prepaid calling cards and paging services provided to alternative wholesale and
small business customers. Dial-up Internet includes dial-up Internet access
services.

Our chief operating decision-maker utilizes revenue information in assessing
performance and making overall operating decisions and resource allocations.
Communications services are generally provided utilizing our fiber optic
networks, which do not make a distinction between the types of services
provided. Profit and loss information for WorldCom, the WorldCom group and the
MCI group is reported only on a consolidated basis to the chief operating
decision-maker and our board of directors.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same policies as those used by
us in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Information about our
segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, is as
follows (in millions):

As discussed in Note C, we deconsolidated our investment in Embratel as of
January 1, 2001. Embratel, which provides communications services in Brazil, was
designated as a separate reportable segment for periods prior to January 1,
2001. Accordingly, we have included Embratel in our segment information
presented for 2000.

See Note N for a reconciliation of the WorldCom group's and the MCI group's
operating results to our consolidated results of operations.

(I) CONTINGENCIES

We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental or
otherwise related to our business and have included loss contingencies in other
current liabilities and other liabilities for these matters. In some instances,
rulings by federal and state regulatory authorities may result in increased
operating costs to us. The outcomes and ramifications of these various legal and
regulatory matters are uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

WorldCom is subject to varying degrees of federal, state, local and
international regulation. In the United States, our subsidiaries are most
heavily regulated by the states, especially for the provision of local exchange
services. We must be certified separately in each state to offer local exchange
and intrastate long distance services. No state, however, subjects us to price
cap or rate of return regulation, nor are we currently required to obtain FCC
authorization for installation or operation of our network facilities used for
domestic services, other than licenses for specific multichannel multipoint
distribution services, wireless communications service and terrestrial microwave
and satellite earth station facilities that utilize radio frequency spectrum.
FCC approval is required for the installation and operation of our international
facilities and services. We are subject to varying degrees of regulation in the
foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and those regulations cover,
among other things, authorization for the installation and operation of network
facilities. No assurance can be given that changes in current or future
regulations adopted by the FCC, state or foreign regulators or legislative
initiatives in the United States or abroad would not have a material adverse
effect on us.

In August 1996, the FCC established nationwide rules pursuant to the Telecom Act
designed to encourage new entrants to compete in local service markets through
interconnection with the incumbent local telephone companies, resale of
incumbent local telephone companies' retail services, and use of individual and
combinations of unbundled network elements, owned by the incumbent local
telephone companies. Unbundled network elements are defined in the Telecom Act
as any "facility or equipment used in the provision of a telecommunication
service," as well as "features, function, and capabilities that are provided by
means of such facility or equipment." In January 1999, the Supreme Court of the
United States confirmed the FCC's authority to issue nationwide local
competition rules, including a pricing methodology for unbundled network
elements. On remand, the FCC clarified the requirement that incumbent local
telephone companies make specific unbundled network elements available to new
entrants. The incumbent local telephone companies have sought reconsideration of
the FCC's order and have petitioned for review of the order in the United States
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. That case is pending.


                                       11
<Page>

In its January 1999 decision, the Supreme Court remanded to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit various substantive questions concerning
the FCC's rules for pricing unbundled network elements. In July 2000, the Eighth
Circuit upheld the use of a forward-looking methodology but struck down the
portion of the rule that calculates costs based on efficient technology and
design choices. At the request of various parties, including WorldCom, the
Supreme Court is reviewing the Eighth Circuit's decision. The Supreme Court
heard oral argument in October 2001, and a ruling is expected in the first half
of 2002.

The Telecom Act requires Bell Operating Companies to petition the FCC for
permission to offer long distance services for each state within their region.
Section 271 of the Telecom Act provides that for these applications to be
granted, the FCC must find, among other things, that the Bell Operating
Companies have demonstrated that they have satisfied a 14-point competitive
checklist to open their local network to competition and that granting the
petition is in the public interest. To date, the FCC has rejected five
traditional phone company applications and it has granted seven: Verizon's for
New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania and SBC's for Texas,
Kansas and Oklahoma. WorldCom, and other new entrants to the local market, have
appealed to the D.C. Circuit the approvals for Kansas, Oklahoma and
Massachusetts alleging that the FCC erred in concluding that the incumbent local
telephone companies had satisfied the section 271 checklist prior to granting
the application. Briefing of the Kansas and Oklahoma case concluded in July 2001
and argument was held in September 2001; a briefing schedule has not been
established for the Massachusetts appeal. BellSouth has filed another
application for Georgia. SBC has also filed a petition for Missouri and
Arkansas. Other applications may be challenged at any time. WorldCom has
challenged, and will continue to challenge, any application that does not
satisfy the requirements of section 271 or the FCC's local competition rules. To
date, these challenges have focused on the pricing of unbundled network elements
and on the adequacy of the Bell Operating Companies' operations support systems.
In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that would have the
effect of allowing Bell Operating Companies to offer in-region long distance
data services without satisfying section 271 of the Telecom Act and/or of making
it more difficult for competitors to resell incumbent local telephone company
high-speed Internet access services or to lease the unbundled network elements
used to provide these services. To date, WorldCom and others have successfully
opposed these legislative initiatives.

In December 1999, the FCC concluded that in providing high speed digital
subscriber line services, the incumbent local telephone companies should be
required to share primary telephone lines with competitive local exchange
carriers, and the FCC identified the high frequency portion of the loop as a
network element. In February 2000, Qwest and the United States Telephone
Association petitioned for review of the order in the United States Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; the Court held the case in abeyance pending
reconsideration at the FCC. On January 19, 2001, the FCC issued its order on
reconsideration which again is favorable to WorldCom and other firms seeking to
gain access to the high bandwidth portion of the local loop. More specifically,
the FCC clarified that the requirement to share lines applies to the entire
loop, even where the traditional phone company has deployed fiber in the loop.
Under the order, the incumbent local telephone companies must permit competing
carriers to self-provision or partner with a data carrier in order to furnish
voice and data service on the same line. The incumbent local telephone companies
have appealed this ruling and we have intervened in support of the FCC's order.

In February 1999, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling and Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking regarding the regulatory treatment of calls to Internet service
providers. Prior to the FCC's order, over thirty state public utility
commissions issued orders finding that carriers, including WorldCom, are
entitled to collect reciprocal compensation for completing calls to Internet
service providers under the terms of their interconnection agreements with
incumbent local telephone companies. Many of these public utility commission
decisions were appealed by the incumbent local telephone companies and, since
the FCC's order, many incumbent local telephone companies have filed new cases
at the public utility commissions or in court. WorldCom petitioned for review of
the FCC's order in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit,
which vacated the order and remanded the case to the FCC for further
proceedings. In April 2001, the FCC issued an Order on Remand and Report and
Order asserting jurisdiction over calls to Internet service providers and
establishing a three-year transitional scheme of decreasing reciprocal
compensation rates. WorldCom has filed a petition for review of the FCC's order
with the D.C. Circuit, and the Court will hear oral arguments in February 2002.

It is possible that rights held by WorldCom to multi-channel multipoint
distribution service and/or instructional television fixed service spectrum may
be disrupted by FCC decisions to re-allocate some or all of that spectrum to


                                       12
<Page>

other services. If this re-allocation were to occur, we cannot predict whether
current deployment plans for our multi-channel multipoint distribution service
services will be sustainable.

In November 2000, class action complaints were filed in the United States
District Courts for the Southern District of Mississippi, the Southern District
of New York, and the District of Columbia against WorldCom and some of its
executive officers. All of these actions were consolidated in the Southern
District of Mississippi on March 27, 2001, along with another purported class
action lawsuit filed on behalf of individuals who purchased stock in Intermedia
Communications Inc. between September 5 and November 1, 2000, which action
asserts substantially similar claims and alleges that after the announcement of
the WorldCom-Intermedia merger, the price of Intermedia stock was tied to the
price of WorldCom stock. On June 1, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated
amended complaint. Among other things, the consolidated amended complaint
alleged that statements regarding WorldCom's revenues, the integration of MCI,
the success of UUNET, and the expansion of WorldCom's network were false;
WorldCom's financial disclosures were false; and WorldCom's announcement of its
"generation d" initiative was misleading. Based on these allegations, the
consolidated amended complaint asserts claims for violation of Section 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and
Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The consolidated amended
complaint seeks to certify a class of persons who purchased WorldCom shares
between February 10, 2000 and November 1, 2000, inclusive; it does not assert
separate claims on behalf of purchasers of Intermedia shares. On August 7, 2001,
WorldCom and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
consolidated amended complaint in its entirety. We believe that the factual
allegations and legal claims asserted in the consolidated amended complaint are
without merit and intend to defend them vigorously.

In August 1997, three complaints were filed in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia, as class actions on behalf of purchasers of MCI
shares. The three cases were consolidated on April 1, 1998. On or about May 8,
1998, the plaintiffs in all three cases filed a consolidated amended complaint
alleging, on behalf of purchasers of MCI's shares between July 11, 1997 and
August 21, 1997, inclusive, that MCI and some of its officers and directors
failed to disclose material information about MCI, including that MCI was
renegotiating the terms of the MCI BT merger agreement. The consolidated amended
complaint seeks damages and other relief. WorldCom and the other defendants have
moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.

(J) LONG-TERM DEBT

On June 8, 2001, we replaced our existing $7 billion 364-Day Revolving Credit
and Term Loan Agreement with two new credit facilities consisting of a $2.65
billion 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement (the "364-Day Facility") and a $1.6
billion Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Multi-Year Facility"). The 364-Day
Facility and the Multi-Year Facility, together with our existing $3.75 billion
Amended and Restated Facility A Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Existing
Facility"), provide us with aggregate credit facilities of $8 billion. These
credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program and
for other general corporate purposes.

The Existing Facility and the Multi-Year Facility mature on June 30, 2002 and
June 8, 2006, respectively. The 364-Day Facility has a 364-day term, which may
be extended for successive 364-day terms to the extent of the committed amounts
from those lenders consenting thereto, with a requirement that lenders holding
51% of the committed amounts consent and so long as the final maturity date does
not extend beyond June 8, 2006. Additionally, we may elect to convert the
principal debt outstanding under the 364-Day Facility to a term loan maturing no
later than one year after the conversion date, so long as the final maturity
date does not extend beyond June 8, 2006. The Existing Facility is subject to
annual commitment fees not to exceed 0.25% of any unborrowed portion of the
facilities. The 364-Day Facility and the Multi-Year Facility are subject to
annual facility fees not to exceed 0.20% or 0.25%, respectively, of the average
daily commitment under each such facility (whether used or unused).

The credit facilities bear interest payable in varying periods, depending on the
interest period, not to exceed six months, or with respect to any Eurodollar
Rate borrowing, 12 months if available to all lenders, at rates selected by us
under the terms of the credit facilities, including a Base Rate or Eurodollar
Rate, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for the Eurodollar Rate
borrowing generally varies from 0.35% to 0.75% as to loans under the Existing
Facility, from 0.29% to 0.80% as to loans under the 364-Day Facility and 0.27%
to 0.75% as to loans under the Multi-Year Facility, in each case based upon our
then current debt ratings.


                                       13
<Page>

The credit facilities are unsecured but include a negative pledge of our assets
and, subject to exceptions, the covered subsidiaries. The credit facilities
require compliance with a financial covenant based on the ratio of total debt to
total capitalization, calculated on a consolidated basis. The credit facilities
require compliance with operating covenants which limit, among other things, the
incurrence of additional indebtedness by us and the covered subsidiaries and
sales of assets and mergers and dissolutions. The credit facilities do not
restrict distributions to shareholders, provided we are not in default under the
credit facilities. As of the date of this filing, we were in compliance with
these covenants.

On May 9, 2001, we completed the pricing of a public debt offering of
approximately $11.9 billion principal amount of debt securities, based on
currency exchange rates on May 8, 2001. The net proceeds of $11.7 billion have
been or will be used for general corporate purposes, including to repay
commercial paper, and repayment of $1.5 billion of our 6.125% notes due August
15, 2001 and $1.5 billion of our floating rate notes due November 26, 2001. The
public debt offering consisted of the following series of notes:

All of the notes, except for the 6.50% Notes due 2004 are redeemable, as a whole
or in part, at our option, at any time or from time to time, at respective
redemption prices equal to:

In the case of the U.S. dollar notes, the greater of:

      o     100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and
      o     the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments,
            as defined therein, discounted, on a semiannual basis, assuming a
            360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury
            Rate, as defined therein, plus:
            o     30 basis points for the Notes due 2011, and
            o     35 basis points for the Notes due 2031;

In the case of the euro notes, the greater of:

      o     the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments,
            as defined therein, discounted, on an annual basis (based on the
            actual number of days elapsed divided by 365 or 366, as the case may
            be), at the Reference Euro Dealer Rate, as defined therein, plus 25
            basis points; and

In the case of the sterling notes, the greater of:

      o     100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and
      o     the price expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal
            places, with .0005 being rounded up) at which the Gross Redemption
            Yield, as defined therein, on the outstanding principal amount of
            the notes on the Reference Date, as defined therein, is equal to the
            Gross Redemption Yield (determined by reference to the middle-market
            price) at 3:00 p.m. (London time) on that date on the Benchmark
            Gilt, as defined therein, plus 25 basis points;

plus, in the case of the U.S. dollar notes, the euro notes and the sterling
notes, accrued interest to the date of redemption which has not been paid.

In connection with the Intermedia merger, we assumed Intermedia's outstanding
debt including $1.2 billion of senior discount notes with interest rates ranging
from 11.25% to 12.5%, $0.9 billion of senior notes with interest rates ranging
from 8.5% to 9.5%, credit facility borrowings of $258 million and other
long-term debt including capital


                                       14
<Page>

leases of $0.6 billion. We repaid the Intermedia credit facility borrowings of
$258 million and subsequently terminated Intermedia's credit facility during the
third quarter of 2001. Additionally, on September 28, 2001, we redeemed all of
Intermedia's 12.5% senior discount notes for $337 million. Cash balances were
used to pay all amounts under the Intermedia credit facility and Intermedia
12.5% senior discount notes.

During the third quarter of 2001, $1.5 billion of 6.125% senior notes matured,
we redeemed all of our outstanding 8.875% senior notes due 2006 for $694
million, and we retired $1.1 billion of our outstanding debt through open market
debt repurchases (including $481 million of outstanding debt assumed in the
Intermedia merger). Cash balances were used to repay these amounts.

The following table sets forth our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2001 (in
millions):

On August 20, 2001, the holder of our Series G preferred stock exercised its
right to require us to redeem all of the outstanding Series G preferred stock at
par plus accrued dividends, or approximately $200 million in the aggregate.

The Series D, E and F preferred stock is currently redeemable in whole or in
part, at our option for cash plus accrued and unpaid dividends at rates ranging
from 103% down to 100% beginning 2004 and thereafter for the Series D and E
preferred stock and from 104% down to 100% beginning 2005 and thereafter for the
Series F preferred stock.


                                       15
<Page>

Dividends on the Series D, E and F preferred stock are payable in cash or shares
of our common stock, at our election on each July 15, October 15, January 15 and
April 15. We paid the initial dividend on July 15, 2001 in cash and we expect to
continue to pay cash dividends on our Series D, E and F preferred stock.

The Series D, E and F preferred shareholders are generally entitled to vote on
the basis of 0.10 of a vote per share of Series D, E or F preferred stock on all
matters.

In October 2001, we exercised our option to redeem all of our outstanding Series
B Preferred Stock. Prior to the redemption date, substantially all of the
holders of our Series B Preferred Stock elected to convert the preferred stock
into 0.1460868 shares of WorldCom group stock and 0.005843472 shares of MCI
group stock for each share of Series B Preferred Stock held.

(L) REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARIES

At the time of the Intermedia merger, Intermedia had outstanding Intermedia
Series B Preferred Stock, and Digex had outstanding Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, or Digex Series A Preferred Stock.

As of September 30, 2001, there were 549,896 shares of Intermedia Series B
Preferred Stock outstanding. Dividends on the Intermedia Series B Preferred
Stock accumulate at a rate of 13.5% of the aggregate liquidation preference
thereof and are payable quarterly, in arrears. Dividends are payable in cash or,
at Intermedia's option, by the issuance of additional shares of Intermedia
Series B Preferred Stock having an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the
amount of such dividends. Historically, Intermedia has paid the Intermedia
Series B Preferred Stock dividend by the issuance of additional shares of
Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock. The Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock is
subject to mandatory redemption at its liquidation preference of $1,000 per
share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on March 31, 2009. The Intermedia
Series B Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the option of Intermedia at any
time after March 31, 2002 at rates commencing with 106.75%, declining to 100% on
March 31, 2007. Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock is generally entitled to
one-tenth of one vote per share on all matters voting together with the common
stock of Intermedia as a single class.

The Digex Series A Preferred Stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of
$100 million, and is convertible into approximately 1,462,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock of Digex. The Digex Series A Preferred Stock does not pay dividends
and there are no voting rights.

(M) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's, or FASB's, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that
derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at fair value. As of January 1, 2001, our exposure to
derivative financial instruments primarily consisted of option collar
transactions designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated sales of an equity
investment, which we maintain to minimize the impact of adverse changes in the
market price of the related equity investment, and various equity warrants. The
initial adoption of SFAS No. 133 provided a net transition gain from our
designated cash flow hedges resulting in an increase in other comprehensive
income of approximately $28 million. We recorded no net impact from adoption of
SFAS No. 133 related to the various equity warrants. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2001, shares of the hedged equity investment were sold and
we reclassified respective hedging gains of $88 million from accumulated
comprehensive income to miscellaneous income. As of September 30, 2001, we
estimate during the next twelve months we will reclassify from accumulated
comprehensive income into earnings approximately $46 million relating to our
derivative financial instruments as the underlying hedged equity investment is
sold. The actual amounts that will be reclassified to earnings over the next
twelve months will vary from this amount as a result of changes in market
conditions. No amounts were reclassified to earnings resulting from any
ineffective portion of the designated derivative hedges or from the
discontinuance of designation of any cash flow hedges.

(N) CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION

Below is the consolidating financial information of the WorldCom group and the
MCI group. The financial information reflects the businesses attributed to the
WorldCom group and the MCI group including the allocation of revenues and
expenses between the WorldCom group and the MCI group in accordance with our
allocation policies.

The attribution of the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses for
each group, as reflected in our interim consolidated financial statements, which
are consolidated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, is primarily based on specific identification of the
businesses included in each group. Where specific identification was
impractical, other methods and criteria were used that our management believes
are equitable and provide a reasonable estimate of the assets, liabilities,
equity, revenues and expenses attributable to each group. Our shared corporate
services and related balance sheet amounts (such as executive management, human
resources, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, treasury, strategic planning and
information systems support) have been attributed to the WorldCom group or the
MCI group based upon identification of such services specifically benefiting
each group. Where determinations based on specific usage alone are impractical,
other methods and criteria were used that our management believes are equitable
and provide a reasonable estimate of the cost attributable to each group. Our
management believes that the allocation methods developed will be comparable to
the expected future allocation methods.

Our board of directors or any special committee appointed by the board of
directors may, without shareholder approval, change the polices set forth in our
tracking stock policy statement, including any resolution implementing the
provisions of our tracking stock policy statement. Our board of directors or any
special committee appointed by the board of directors also may, without
shareholder approval, adopt additional policies or make exceptions with respect
to the application of the policies described in our tracking stock policy
statement in connection with particular facts and circumstances, all as our
board of directors or any special committee appointed by the board of directors
may determine to be in our best interests as a whole. Any such change, adoption
or exception will be final, binding and conclusive unless otherwise determined
by our board of directors or any special committee appointed by the board of
directors.

           WORLDCOM GROUP (AN INTEGRATED BUSINESS OF WORLDCOM, INC.)

                     NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(A) GENERAL

The combined financial statements included herein for the WorldCom group (an
integrated business of WorldCom, Inc.), are unaudited and have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
for interim financial reporting and SEC regulations. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the
opinion of our management, the combined financial statements of the WorldCom
group reflect all adjustments (of a normal and recurring nature) which are
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the interim periods. These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December
31, 2000. The results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2001 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ending December 31, 2001.

(B) RECAPITALIZATION

On June 7, 2001, our shareholders approved a recapitalization involving the
creation of two separately traded tracking stocks:

      o     WorldCom group stock, which is intended to reflect the performance
            of our data, Internet, international and commercial voice businesses
            and is quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
            "WCOM", and

      o     MCI group stock, which is intended to reflect the performance of our
            consumer, small business, wholesale long distance voice and data,
            wireless messaging and dial-up Internet access businesses and is
            quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
            "MCIT".

In connection with the recapitalization, we amended our articles of
incorporation to replace our existing common stock with two new series of common
stock that are intended to reflect, or track, the performance of the businesses
attributed to the WorldCom group and the MCI group. Effective with the
recapitalization on June 7, 2001, each share of our existing common stock was
changed into one share of WorldCom group stock and 1/25 of a share of MCI group
stock.

A tracking stock is a separate class of a company's common stock intended to
provide a return to investors based upon the financial performance of a distinct
business unit of the company, sometimes referred to as the targeted business.
These targeted businesses are collections of businesses that we have grouped
together in order for us to issue WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock. The
ownership of the targeted business does not change, and while each of the
classes of stock trade separately, all shareholders are common shareholders of a
single company, WorldCom, and are subject to all risks of an investment in
WorldCom as a whole.

During the second quarter of 2001, we declared the first quarterly dividend for
the MCI group common stock. A cash dividend of $0.60 per share of MCI group
common stock, or approximately $70 million in the aggregate, was paid on October
15, 2001 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 28,
2001. During the third quarter of 2001, we declared the fourth quarter dividend
of $0.60 per share of MCI group common stock to be paid on January 15, 2002 to
shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2001.

The MCI group was initially allocated notional debt of $6 billion and our
remaining debt was allocated on a notional basis to the WorldCom group. We
intend, for so long as the WorldCom group stock and the MCI group stock remains
outstanding, to include in filings by WorldCom under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, the combined financial statements of each of the WorldCom
group and the MCI group. These combined financial statements will be prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
and in the case of annual financial statements, will be audited. These combined
financial statements are not legally required under current law or SEC
regulations.


                                       29
<Page>

Voting rights of the holders of the WorldCom group stock and the MCI group stock
are prorated based on the relative market values of WorldCom group stock and MCI
group stock. We will conduct shareholder meetings that encompass all holders of
voting stock. The WorldCom group and the MCI group shareholders will vote
together as a single class on all matters brought to a vote of shareholders,
including the election of our directors.

Our board of directors may at any time convert each outstanding share of MCI
group stock into shares of WorldCom group stock at 110% of the relative trading
value of MCI group stock for the 20 days prior to the announcement of the
conversion. No premium will be paid on a conversion that occurs three years
after the issuance of MCI group stock.

If all or substantially all of the WorldCom group or MCI group assets are sold,
either: (i) the relevant shareholders will receive a distribution equal to the
fair value of the net proceeds of the sale, either by special dividend or by
redemption of shares; or (ii) each outstanding share of MCI group stock will be
converted into shares of WorldCom group stock at 110% or 100% of the relative
trading value of MCI group stock for a 10 trading day period following the sale.

(C) EMBRATEL DECONSOLIDATION

During the second quarter of 2001, we reached a long-term strategic decision to
restructure our investment in Embratel. The restructuring included the
resignation of certain Embratel Board of Directors seats, the irrevocable
obligation to vote a portion of our common shares in a specified manner and the
transfer of certain economic rights associated with such shares to an unrelated
third party. Based on these actions, the accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States prohibit the continued consolidation of Embratel's
results. Accordingly, we have deconsolidated Embratel's results effective
January 1, 2001.

(D) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On July 1, 2001, we acquired Intermedia Communications Inc. for approximately
$5.8 billion, including long-term debt, pursuant to the merger of a wholly owned
subsidiary with and into Intermedia, with Intermedia continuing as the surviving
corporation and as a subsidiary of WorldCom. As a result of the Intermedia
merger, we acquired a controlling interest in Digex, Incorporated, or Digex, a
provider of managed Web and application hosting services for some of the world's
fastest growing companies. In connection with the Intermedia merger,
stockholders of Intermedia received one share of WorldCom group common stock (or
57.1 million WorldCom group shares in the aggregate) and 1/25th of a share of
MCI group common stock (or 2.3 million MCI group shares in the aggregate) for
each share of Intermedia common stock they owned. Holders of Intermedia
preferred stock, other than Intermedia's 13.5% Series B Redeemable Exchangeable
Preferred Stock due 2009, or Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock, received one
share of a class or series of our preferred stock, with substantially identical
terms, which were established upon consummation of the Intermedia merger. As a
result of the merger with Intermedia, we own approximately 90% of the voting
securities of Intermedia.

Upon effectiveness of the merger with Intermedia, the then outstanding and
unexercised options for shares of Intermedia common stock were converted into
options exercisable for an aggregate of approximately 10 million shares of
WorldCom group common stock having the same terms and conditions as the
Intermedia options, except that the exercise price and the number of shares
issuable upon exercise were divided and multiplied, respectively, by 1.0319. The
merger with Intermedia was accounted for as a purchase and was allocated to the
WorldCom group.

The purchase price in the Intermedia merger was allocated based on appraised
fair values at the date of acquisition. This resulted in an excess purchase
price over net assets acquired of $5.1 billion of which $67 million was
allocated to customer lists, which will be amortized over approximately four
years on a straight line basis. The remaining excess of $5.0 billion has been
allocated to goodwill and tradename which are not subject to amortization, and
the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In connection with the Intermedia merger, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice is requiring us to dispose of Intermedia's Internet
service provider business, which provides integrated Internet connectivity
solutions. In addition to this required divestiture, we have also committed to a
plan to sell Intermedia's Advanced Building Network business, which provides
centralized telecommunications services in multi-tenant commercial office
buildings, and the systems integration business through which Intermedia sells,
installs, operates and maintains business telephony customer premise equipment
for its customers. We included the appraised fair values of these


                                       30
<Page>

assets to be disposed of in our initial allocation of the Intermedia purchase
price and also included accrued anticipated losses expected to be incurred
through disposal date. Any difference between the actual results of operations
and the amounts accrued will result in an adjustment of goodwill unless there is
a difference resulting from a post-merger event. For the three months ended
September 30, 2001, operating losses, exclusive of associated depreciation and
amortization for these assets to be disposed of were approximately $25 million,
before corporate allocations. We anticipate that we will complete these planned
disposals within the next twelve months.

Since the Intermedia merger, WorldCom initiated plans to improve cash flow and
operating results by reorganizing and restructuring Intermedia's operations.
These plans include workforce reductions and other administrative cost savings,
the discontinuance of all product lines with unacceptable or negative margins
and the ultimate disposal of all assets associated with such product lines or
businesses.

(E) EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our consolidated financial statements present basic and diluted earnings per
share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock using the two-class method.
The two-class method is an earnings formula that determines the attributed
earnings per share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock according to
participation rights in undistributed earnings. The combined financial
statements of the WorldCom group do not present earnings per share because
WorldCom group stock is a series of our common stock, and the WorldCom group is
not a legal entity with a capital structure.

For purposes of our consolidated financial statements, basic earnings per share
attributed to WorldCom group stock is computed by dividing attributed net income
for the period by the number of weighted-average shares of WorldCom group stock
then outstanding. Diluted earnings per share attributed to WorldCom group stock
is computed by dividing attributed net income for the period by the
weighted-average number of shares of WorldCom group stock outstanding, including

(H) SEGMENT INFORMATION

Based on its organizational structure, the WorldCom group operates in two
reportable segments: Commercial voice, data and Internet, and International
operations. The WorldCom group's reportable segments represent business units
that primarily offer similar products and services; however, the business units
are managed separately due to the type and class of customer as well as the
geographic dispersion of their operations. The Commercial voice, data and
Internet segment includes voice, data and other types of domestic communications
services for commercial customers, and Internet services including dedicated
access and web and application hosting services. International operations
provide voice, data, Internet and other similar types of communications services
to customers primarily in Europe and the Asia Pacific region.

Our chief operating decision-maker utilizes revenue information in assessing
performance and making overall operating decisions and resource allocations.
Communications services are generally provided utilizing our fiber optic
networks, which do not make a distinction between the types of services
provided. Profit and loss information is reported only on a combined basis to
our chief operating decision-maker and our board of directors.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same policies as those used by
the WorldCom group in preparing its combined financial statements. Information
about the WorldCom group's segments for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2000 and 2001, is as follows (in millions):

As discussed in Note C, we deconsolidated our investment in Embratel as of
January 1, 2001. Embratel, which provides communications services in Brazil, was
designated as a separate reportable segment of the WorldCom group for periods
prior to January 1, 2001. Accordingly, we have included Embratel in our WorldCom
group segment information presented for 2000.

group and the MCI group based upon a number of factors including estimated
future cash flows and the ability to pay debt service and dividends of each of
the groups. In addition, we considered certain measures of creditworthiness,
such as coverage ratios and various tests of liquidity, in the allocation
process. Our management believes that the initial allocation is equitable and
supportable by both the WorldCom group and the MCI group. Each group's debt will
increase or decrease by the amount of any net cash generated by, or required to
fund, the group's operating activities, investing activities, share repurchases
and other financing activities.

Interest expense on borrowings incurred by us and allocated to the WorldCom
group reflects the difference between our actual interest expense and the
interest expense allocated to the MCI group. The MCI group was allocated
interest based on our weighted-average interest rate, excluding capitalized
interest, of our debt plus 1 1/4 percent.

See Note J to our interim consolidated financial statements for information
pertaining to our outstanding long-term debt.

On August 20, 2001, the holder of our Series G preferred stock exercised its
right to require us to redeem all of the outstanding Series G preferred stock at
par plus accrued dividends, or approximately $200 million in the aggregate.


                                       33
<Page>

The Series D, E and F preferred stock is currently redeemable in whole or in
part, at our option for cash plus accrued and unpaid dividends at rates ranging
from 103% down to 100% beginning 2004 and thereafter for the Series D and E
preferred stock and from 104% down to 100% beginning 2005 and thereafter for the
Series F preferred stock.

Dividends on the Series D, E and F preferred stock are payable in cash or shares
of our common stock, at our election on each July 15, October 15, January 15 and
April 15. We paid the initial dividend on July 15, 2001 in cash and we expect to
continue to pay cash dividends on our Series D, E and F preferred stock.

The Series D, E and F preferred shareholders are generally entitled to vote on
the basis of 0.10 of a vote per share of Series D, E or F preferred stock on all
matters.

In October 2001, we exercised our option to redeem all of our outstanding Series
B Preferred Stock. Prior to the redemption date, substantially all of the
holders of our Series B Preferred Stock elected to convert the preferred stock
into 0.1460868 shares of WorldCom group stock and 0.005843472 shares of MCI
group stock for each share of Series B Preferred Stock held.

(K) REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARIES

At the time of the Intermedia merger, Intermedia had outstanding Intermedia
Series B Preferred Stock, and Digex had outstanding Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, or Digex Series A Preferred Stock.

As of September 30, 2001, there were 549,896 shares of Intermedia Series B
Preferred Stock outstanding. Dividends on the Intermedia Series B Preferred
Stock accumulate at a rate of 13.5% of the aggregate liquidation preference
thereof and are payable quarterly, in arrears. Dividends are payable in cash or,
at Intermedia's option, by the issuance of additional shares of Intermedia
Series B Preferred Stock having an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the
amount of such dividends. Historically, Intermedia has paid the Intermedia
Series B Preferred Stock dividend by the issuance of additional shares of
Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock. The Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock is
subject to mandatory redemption at its liquidation preference of $1,000 per
share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on March 31, 2009. The Intermedia
Series B Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the option of Intermedia at any
time after March 31, 2002 at rates commencing with 106.75%, declining to 100% on
March 31, 2007. Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock is generally entitled to
one-tenth of one vote per share on all matters voting together with the common
stock of Intermedia as a single class.

The Digex Series A Preferred Stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of
$100 million, and is convertible into approximately 1,462,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock of Digex. The Digex Series A Preferred Stock does not pay dividends
and there are no voting rights.

(L) CONTINGENCIES

The WorldCom group's shareholders are subject to all of the risks related to an
investment in WorldCom and the WorldCom group, including the effects of any
legal proceedings and claims against the MCI group. See Note I to our interim
consolidated financial statements for information related to our contingencies.

(M) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's, or FASB's, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that
derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at fair value. As of January 1, 2001, our exposure to
derivative financial instruments primarily consisted of option collar
transactions designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated sales of an equity
investment, which we maintain to minimize the impact of adverse changes in the
market price of the related equity investment, and various equity warrants. The
initial adoption of SFAS No. 133 provided a net transition gain from our
designated cash flow hedges resulting in an increase in other comprehensive
income of approximately $28 million. We recorded no net impact from adoption of
SFAS No. 133 related to the various equity warrants. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2001, shares of the hedged equity investment were sold and
we reclassified


                                       34
<Page>

respective hedging gains of $88 million from accumulated comprehensive income to
miscellaneous income. As of September 30, 2001, we estimate during the next
twelve months we will reclassify from accumulated comprehensive income into
earnings approximately $46 million relating to our derivative financial
instruments as the underlying hedged equity investment is sold. The actual
amounts that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months will
vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. No amounts
were reclassified to earnings resulting from any ineffective portion of the
designated derivative hedges or from the discontinuance of designation of any
cash flow hedges. All of our derivative instruments are attributed to the
WorldCom group.

              MCI GROUP (AN INTEGRATED BUSINESS OF WORLDCOM, INC.)

                     NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(A) GENERAL

The combined financial statements included herein for the MCI group (an
integrated business of WorldCom, Inc.), are unaudited and have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
for interim financial reporting and SEC regulations. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the
opinion of our management, the combined financial statements of the MCI group
reflect all adjustments (of a normal and recurring nature) which are necessary
to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the interim periods. These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December
31, 2000. The results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2001 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ending December 31, 2001.

(B) RECAPITALIZATION

On June 7, 2001, our shareholders approved a recapitalization involving the
creation of two separately traded tracking stocks:

      o     WorldCom group stock, which is intended to reflect the performance
            of our data, Internet, international and commercial voice businesses
            and is quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
            "WCOM", and

      o     MCI group stock, which is intended to reflect the performance of our
            consumer, small business, wholesale long distance voice and data,
            wireless messaging and dial-up Internet access businesses and is
            quoted on The Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
            "MCIT".

In connection with the recapitalization, we amended our articles of
incorporation to replace our existing common stock with two new series of common
stock that are intended to reflect, or track, the performance of the businesses
attributed to the WorldCom group and the MCI group. Effective with the
recapitalization on June 7, 2001, each share of our existing common stock was
changed into one share of WorldCom group stock and 1/25 of a share of MCI group
stock.

A tracking stock is a separate class of a company's common stock intended to
provide a return to investors based upon the financial performance of a distinct
business unit of the company, sometimes referred to as the targeted business.
These targeted businesses are collections of businesses that we have grouped
together in order for us to issue WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock. The
ownership of the targeted business does not change, and while each of the
classes of stock trade separately, all shareholders are common shareholders of a
single company, WorldCom, and are subject to all risks of an investment in
WorldCom as a whole.

During the second quarter of 2001, we declared the first quarterly dividend for
the MCI group common stock. A cash dividend of $0.60 per share of MCI group
common stock, or approximately $70 million in the aggregate, was paid on October
15, 2001 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 28,
2001. During the third quarter of 2001, we declared the fourth quarter dividend
of $0.60 per share of MCI group common stock to be paid on January 15, 2002 to
shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2001.

The MCI group was initially allocated notional debt of $6 billion and our
remaining debt was allocated on a notional basis to the WorldCom group. We
intend, for so long as the WorldCom group stock and the MCI group stock remains
outstanding, to include in filings by WorldCom under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, the combined financial statements of each of the WorldCom
group and the MCI group. These combined financial statements will be prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
and in the case of annual financial statements, will be audited. These combined
financial statements are not legally required under current law or SEC
regulations.


                                       39
<PAGE>

Voting rights of the holders of the WorldCom group and the MCI group stock are
prorated based on the relative market values of WorldCom group stock and MCI
group stock. We will conduct shareholder meetings that encompass all holders of
voting stock. The WorldCom group and the MCI group shareholders will vote
together as a single class on all matters brought to a vote of shareholders,
including the election of our directors.

Our board of directors may at any time convert each outstanding share of MCI
group stock into shares of WorldCom group stock at 110% of the relative trading
value of MCI group stock for the 20 days prior to the announcement of the
conversion. No premium will be paid on a conversion that occurs three years
after the issuance of MCI group stock.

If all or substantially all of the WorldCom group or MCI group assets are sold,
either: (i) the relevant shareholders will receive a distribution equal to the
fair value of the net proceeds of the sale, either by special dividend or by
redemption of shares; or (ii) each outstanding share of MCI group stock will be
converted into shares of WorldCom group stock at 110% or 100% of the relative
trading value of MCI group stock for a 10 trading day period following the sale.

(C) EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our consolidated financial statements present basic and diluted earnings per
share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock using the two-class method.
The two-class method is an earnings formula that determines the attributed
earnings per share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock according to
participation rights in undistributed earnings. The combined financial
statements of the MCI group do not present earnings per share because MCI group
stock is a series of our common stock, and the MCI group is not a legal entity
with a capital structure.

For purposes of our consolidated financial statements, basic earnings per share
attributed to MCI group stock is computed by dividing attributed net income for
the period by the number of weighted-average shares of MCI group stock then
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share attributed to MCI group stock is
computed by dividing attributed net income for the period by the
weighted-average number of shares of MCI group stock outstanding, including the
dilutive effect of MCI group stock equivalents.

(D) SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Interest paid by the MCI group during the nine months ended September 30, 2000
and 2001, amounted to $427 million and $367 million, respectively. Income taxes
paid, net of refunds received, during the nine months ended September 30, 2000
and 2001, totaled $48 million and $1 million, respectively.

(E) SEGMENT INFORMATION

Based on its organizational structure, the MCI group operates in four reportable
segments: Consumer; Wholesale; Alternative channels and small business; and
Dial-up Internet. The MCI group's reportable segments represent business units
that primarily offer similar products and services; however, the business units
are managed separately due to the type and class of customer as well as the
geographic dispersion of their operations. Consumer includes domestic voice
communications services for consumer customers. Wholesale includes domestic long
distance voice and data communications services for wholesale customers.
Alternative channels and small business includes domestic long distance voice
and data, agents, prepaid calling cards and paging services provided to
alternative wholesale and small business customers. Dial-up Internet includes
dial-up Internet access services.

Our chief operating decision-maker utilizes revenue information in assessing
performance and making overall operating decisions and resource allocations.
Communications services are generally provided utilizing our network facilities,
which do not make a distinction between the types of services provided. Profit
and loss information is reported only on a combined basis to our chief operating
decision-maker and our board of directors.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same policies as those used by
the MCI group in preparing its combined financial statements. Information about
the MCI group's segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2000
and 2001, is as follows (in millions):

(F) LONG-TERM DEBT

As of January 1, 2000, $6.0 billion of our outstanding debt was notionally
allocated to the MCI group and the remaining outstanding debt was notionally
allocated to the WorldCom group. Our debt was allocated between the WorldCom
group and the MCI group based upon a number of factors including estimated
future cash flows and the ability to pay debt service and dividends of each of
the groups. In addition, we considered certain measures of creditworthiness,
such as coverage ratios and various tests of liquidity, in the allocation
process. Our management believes that the initial allocation is equitable and
supportable by both the WorldCom group and the MCI group. Each group's debt will
increase or decrease by the amount of any net cash generated by, or required to
fund, the group's operating activities, investing activities, share repurchases
and other financing activities. During 2001, the MCI group repaid $408 million
of the notionally allocated debt and as of September 30, 2001, the MCI group's
long-term debt balance was $5.6 billion.

Interest expense on borrowings incurred by us and allocated to the WorldCom
group reflects the difference between our actual interest expense and the
interest expense allocated to the MCI group. The MCI group was allocated
interest based on our weighted-average interest rate, excluding capitalized
interest, of our debt plus 1 1/4 percent.

See Note J to our interim consolidated financial statements for information
pertaining to our outstanding long-term debt.

CONTINGENCIES

The MCI group's shareholders are subject to all of the risks related to an
investment in WorldCom and the MCI group, including the effects of any legal
proceedings and claims against the WorldCom group. See Note I to our interim
consolidated financial statements for information related to our contingencies.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

On June 7, 2001, our shareholders approved a recapitalization involving the
creation of two separately traded tracking stocks: WorldCom group stock, which
is intended to track the separate performance of our data, Internet,
international and commercial voice businesses; and MCI group stock, which is
intended to reflect the performance of our consumer, small business, wholesale
long distance voice and data, wireless messaging and dial-up Internet access
businesses.

Through the businesses that we have realigned as the WorldCom group, which have
an extensive, advanced facilities-based global communications network, we
provide a broad range of integrated communications and managed network services
to both U.S. and non-U.S. based corporations. Offerings include data services
such as frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode and Internet protocol networks;
Internet related services, including dedicated access, virtual private networks,
digital subscriber lines, web centers encompassing application and server
hosting and managed data services; commercial voice services; and international
services.

Through the businesses that we have realigned as the MCI group, we provide a
broad range of retail and wholesale communications services, including long
distance voice and data communications, consumer local voice communications,
wireless messaging, private line services and dial-up Internet access services.
Our retail services are provided to consumers and small businesses in the United
States. We are the second largest carrier of long distance telecommunications
services in the United States. We provide a wide range of long distance
telecommunications services, including: basic long distance telephone service,
dial around, collect calling, operator assistance and calling card services
(including prepaid calling cards) and toll free or 800 services. We offer these
services individually and in combinations. Through combined offerings, we
provide customers with benefits such as single billing, unified services for
multi-location companies and customized calling plans. Our wholesale businesses
include wholesale voice and data services provided to carrier customers and
other resellers and dial-up Internet access services.

On July 1, 2001, we acquired Intermedia Communications Inc. for approximately
$5.8 billion, including assumed long-term debt, pursuant to the merger of a
wholly owned subsidiary with and into Intermedia, with Intermedia continuing as
the surviving corporation and as a subsidiary of WorldCom. As a result of the
Intermedia merger, we acquired a controlling interest in Digex, Incorporated, or
Digex, a provider of managed Web and application hosting services for some of
the world's fastest growing companies. In connection with the Intermedia merger,
stockholders of Intermedia received one share of WorldCom group common stock (or
57.1 million WorldCom group shares in the aggregate) and 1/25th of a share of
MCI group common stock (or 2.3 million MCI group shares in the aggregate) for
each share of Intermedia common stock they owned. Holders of Intermedia
preferred stock, other than Intermedia Series B Preferred Stock, received one
share of a class or series of our preferred stock, with substantially identical
terms, which were established upon consummation of the Intermedia merger. As a
result of the merger with Intermedia, we own approximately 90% of the voting
securities of Intermedia.

Upon effectiveness of the merger with Intermedia, the then outstanding and
unexercised options for shares of Intermedia common stock were converted into
options exercisable for an aggregate of approximately 10 million shares of
WorldCom group common stock having the same terms and conditions as the
Intermedia options, except that the exercise price and the number of shares
issuable upon exercise were divided and multiplied, respectively, by 1.0319. The
merger with Intermedia was accounted for as a purchase and was allocated to the
WorldCom group.

Since the Intermedia merger, WorldCom initiated plans to improve cash flow and
operating results by reorganizing and restructuring Intermedia's operations.
These plans include workforce reductions and other administrative cost savings,
the discontinuance of all product lines with unacceptable or negative margins
and the ultimate disposal of all assets associated with such product lines or
businesses.

During the second quarter of 2001, we reached a long-term strategic decision to
restructure our investment in Embratel. The restructuring included the
resignation of certain Embratel Board of Directors seats, the irrevocable
obligation to vote a portion of our common shares in a specified manner and the
transfer of certain economic rights associated with such shares to an unrelated
third party. Based on these actions, the accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States prohibit the continued consolidation of Embratel's
results. Accordingly, we have


                                       42
<PAGE>

deconsolidated Embratel's results effective January 1, 2001.

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION RELATED TO THE WORLDCOM GROUP AND THE MCI GROUP FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Each of the WorldCom group and the MCI group includes the results of operations
shown in the combined statements of operations and the attributed assets and
liabilities shown in the combined balance sheets of the relevant group. If we
acquire interests in other businesses, we intend to attribute those assets and
any related liabilities to our WorldCom group or our MCI group in accordance
with our tracking stock policy statement. All net income and cash flows
generated by the assets will be attributed to the group to which the assets were
attributed and all net proceeds from any disposition of these assets will also
be attributed to that group.

Although we sometimes refer to such assets and liabilities as those of the
WorldCom group or the MCI group, neither of the groups is a separate legal
entity. Rather, all of the assets of a group are owned by WorldCom and holders
of the WorldCom group stock or the MCI group stock are shareholders of WorldCom
and subject to all of the risks of an investment in WorldCom and all of its
businesses, assets and liabilities.

We intend, for so long as the WorldCom group stock and the MCI group stock
remains outstanding, to include in filings by WorldCom under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the combined financial statements of each of
the WorldCom group and the MCI group. These combined financial statements will
be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, and in the case of annual financial statements, will be audited.
These combined financial statements are not legally required under current law
or SEC regulations.

Our board of directors may at any time modify, make exceptions to, or abandon
any of the policies set forth in our tracking stock policy statement with
respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities, financing arrangements,
assets, liabilities, debt, interest and other matters, or may adopt additional
policies, in each case without shareholder approval. Our board is subject to
fiduciary duties to all of WorldCom's shareholders as one group, not to the
holders of any series of stock separately. Any changes or exceptions will be
made after a determination by our board of what is in the best interests of
WorldCom as a whole, which may be detrimental to the interests of the holders of
one series of stock. The ability to make these changes may make it difficult to
address the future of a group based on the group's past performance.

</Table>

Commercial services revenues, which include the revenues generated from
commercial voice, data, international and Internet services, for the third
quarter of 2001 were $5.5 billion versus $5.8 billion for the third quarter of
2000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, commercial services revenues
were $16.0 billion versus $16.9 billion for the prior year period. As indicated
above, during the second quarter of 2001, we took steps to restructure our
investment in Embratel which resulted in the deconsolidation of Embratel
effective January 1, 2001. Excluding Embratel from the 2000 periods, commercial
services revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001
increased 11.6% and 12.2%, respectively, versus the prior year periods.

Voice revenues for the third quarter of 2001 decreased 5.9% over the prior year
period on traffic growth of 2.2%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001,
voice revenues decreased 5.8% on traffic growth of 4.3%. The revenue decreases
were partially offset by wireless voice revenue increases of 19.1% for the third
quarter of 2001 and 47.9% for the first nine months of 2001.

Data revenues for the third quarter of 2001 increased 18.2% over the prior year
period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, data revenues increased
18.7% over the prior year period. Data includes both commercial long distance
and local dedicated bandwidth sales. As of September 30, 2001, approximately 32%
of data revenues were derived from frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode
services, where we experienced strong demand for capacity increases across the
product set as businesses moved more of their mission-critical applications to
their own networks during the period. Additionally, we continue to experience
strong price pressure for data services in our emerging markets due to
competition and the general decline in economic condition of our customers,
which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future.

International revenues for the third quarter 2001 increased 19.5% to $761
million versus $637 million, excluding Embratel, for the third quarter of 2000.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, international revenues increased
26.8% to $2.2 billion versus $1.7 billion, excluding Embratel, for the prior
year period. Geographically, Europe grew 15.9% and Asia Pacific and other areas
grew 27.4% for the third quarter of 2001. For the first nine months of 2001,
Europe grew 16.3% and Asia Pacific and other areas grew 54.0%. These increases
were partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations that had the effect of
reducing revenues by approximately $50 million in the third quarter of 2001 and
approximately $140 million for the first nine months of 2001. Although our
retail mix is improving towards a more profitable blend of data versus voice,
and retail versus wholesale, our international business continues to experience
significant price pressure on its products.

Internet revenues for the third quarter of 2001 increased 31.5% over the prior
year period. For the first nine months of 2001, Internet revenues increased
32.2% over the prior year period. Growth was driven by demand for dedicated
circuits as business customers continue to migrate their data networks and
applications to Internet-based technologies requiring greater amounts of
bandwidth. Additionally, Internet revenues growth for the third quarter of 2001
included $29 million of Digex revenues, after intercompany eliminations, as a
result of the Intermedia merger. During 2001, we began to introduce our new
managed hosting products and virtual private networks on public and shared
environments. These products, which are in the initial phases of their life
cycle, should gradually contribute to our revenue growth over the next several
quarters. Internet revenues include dedicated Internet access, managed
networking services and applications (such as virtual private networks), web
hosting and electronic commerce and transaction services (such as web centers
and credit card transaction processing).

Consumer revenues for the third quarter of 2001 decreased 5.8% over the prior
year period. For the first nine months of 2001, consumer revenues decreased 6.3%
over the prior year period. The majority of this decrease is attributed to
decreases in calling card, dial around and dial-1 revenues as a result of
consumers' substitution of wire line services with wireless and e-mail. Our
consumer local initiatives continue to perform well as consumer local revenues
increased over 200% for the third quarter of 2001 and over 175% for the first
nine months of 2001 versus the prior year period.

Wholesale revenues for the third quarter of 2001 decreased 22.4% over the prior
year period. For the first nine months of 2001, wholesale revenues decreased
22.8%. The wholesale market continues to be extremely price competitive,
although rate per minute began to stabilize in the second quarter of 2001.
Wholesale revenues during the past year were also impacted by proactive revenue
initiatives, which were made to improve the quality of the wholesale revenue
stream as we shift the MCI group's focus from revenue growth to cash generation.

Alternative channels and small business revenues for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2001 decreased 38.1% and 32.1%, respectively, over the prior
year periods. Alternative channels and small business includes sales agents and
affiliates, wholesale alternative channels, small business, prepaid calling card
and wireless messaging revenues. These decreases are attributed to pricing
pressures in the wholesale and small business markets which negatively affected
revenue growth and gross margins in this area, and proactive initiatives to
de-emphasize services with unacceptable gross margins as we shift the MCI
group's focus from revenue growth to cash generation.

Dial-up Internet revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001
decreased 9.9% and 2.7%, respectively, over the prior year amounts. Our dial
access network has grown 28% to approximately 3.2 million modems as of September
30, 2001, compared with the prior year period. Additionally, Internet connect
hours increased 13.6% to 5.4 billion hours for the first nine months of 2001
versus the prior year. These network usage increases were more than offset by
pricing pressure resulting from the impact of volume discounts and off-net
traffic, which lowered average revenue per hour by approximately 16% for the
third quarter of 2001 and 18% for the first nine months of 2001 versus the prior
year periods.

LINE COSTS. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, our
line costs were as follows (dollars in millions):

</Table>

Line costs as a percentage of revenues for the third quarter of 2001 increased
to 41.8% as compared to 38.5% for the third quarter of 2000. On a year-to-date
basis, line costs as a percentage of revenues increased to 41.8% as compared to
38.6% reported for the same period of the prior year. Excluding Embratel for the
2000 periods, line costs for the third quarter of 2000 were $3.4 billion, or
37.7% of revenues, and line costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2000
were $10.2 billion, or 37.8% of revenues. The increases as a percentage of
revenues reflect the pricing pressure in the commercial data, Internet and
international markets as well as the continued competitive pricing and off-net
traffic in the dial-up Internet business which resulted in a modest increase in
average cost per hour while average dial-up revenues per hour decreased 16% for
the third quarter of 2001 and 18% for the first nine months of 2001.
Additionally, line costs as a percentage of revenues have increased as a result
of the decrease in higher margin calling card and dial around revenues due to
wireless substitution as noted above.

Line costs were partially offset by foreign currency exchange fluctuations,
which had the effect of reducing line costs as a percentage of revenues by
almost one-half of a percentage point for both the three- and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2001, as compared to the prior year periods, and by
increased data and dedicated Internet traffic over our own facilities, which
positively affected line costs as a percentage of revenues by almost one
percentage point for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2001.

The principal components of line costs are access charges and transport charges.
Regulators have historically permitted access charges to be set at levels that
are well above traditional phone companies' costs. As a result, access charges
have been a source of universal service subsidies that enable local exchange
rates to be set at levels that are affordable. We have actively participated in
a variety of state and federal regulatory proceedings with the goal of bringing
access charges to cost-based levels and to fund universal service using explicit
subsidies funded in a competitively neutral manner. We cannot predict the
outcome of these proceedings or whether or not the results will have a material
adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
However, our goal is to manage transport costs through effective utilization of
our networks, favorable contracts with carriers and network efficiencies made
possible as a result of expansion of our customer base.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2001 were
$2.5 billion or 28.1% of revenues as compared to $3.1 billion or 30.7% of
revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2000. Selling, general and
administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2000 includes a $685 million
pre-tax charge ($340 million from WorldCom group and $345 million from MCI
group) associated with specific domestic and international wholesale accounts
that were deemed uncollectible due to bankruptcies, litigation and settlements
of contractual disputes that occurred in the third quarter of 2000. We maintain
general uncollectible reserves based on historical experience, and


                                       47
<PAGE>

specific reserves for items such as bankruptcies, litigation and contractual
settlements that are established in the period in which the settlement is both
estimable and probable. During the third quarter of 2000, an unprecedented
number of our wholesale customers either filed for bankruptcy or changed their
status in bankruptcy from reorganization to liquidation. This, combined with the
third quarter 2000 declines in stock prices for many companies in the
telecommunications industry and the overall tightening of the capital markets,
which limited the access of many telecommunications providers to the necessary
capital to continue operations, led to our specific write-off of such accounts.
Prior to the third quarter 2000 events, the general uncollectible reserves were,
in our view, adequate. Additionally, under contractual arrangements with
traditional phone companies and other competitive local exchange carriers, we
billed the traditional phone companies and competitive local exchange carriers
for traffic originating on the traditional phone company's or competitive local
exchange carrier's networks and terminating on our network. The traditional
phone companies and competitive local exchange carriers have historically
disputed these billings, although the collectibility of these billings had
continued to be affirmed by public service commission and FCC rulings and by the
full payment from a traditional phone company of the largest past due amount.
However, during the third quarter of 2000, court rulings and congressional
discussions led to our negotiation and settlement with certain traditional phone
companies and competitive local exchange carriers for these outstanding
receivables. Based on the outcome of these negotiations, we recorded a specific
provision for the associated uncollectible amounts. Excluding these charges and
Embratel in 2000, selling, general and administrative expenses for the third
quarter of 2000 would have been $2.2 billion or 23.7% of revenues.

On a year-to-date basis, selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenues increased to $8.5 billion, or 31.8% of revenues as
compared to 26.6% for the same period of the prior year. Selling, general and
administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 also
includes pre-tax costs of $865 million ($742 million from WorldCom group and
$123 million from MCI group) related to the write-off of investments in certain
publicly traded and privately held companies, $23 million ($12 million from
WorldCom group and $11 million from MCI group) as a result of the costs
associated with the tracking stock capitalization and $125 million associated
with domestic severance packages and other costs related to our February 2001
workforce reductions. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 includes a $93 million pre-tax
one-time charge associated with the termination of the Sprint Corporation merger
agreement in addition to the charge for uncollectible accounts discussed above.
Excluding these charges and Embratel in 2000, selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues would have been 28.1% for
the first nine months of 2001 versus 24.0% for the first nine months of 2000.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2001, includes increased costs associated with
"generation d" initiatives, which are designed to position us as a leading
supplier of e-business solutions, that include product marketing, customer care,
information systems and product development, employee retention costs, and costs
associated with multichannel multipoint distribution service product
development. Additionally, the increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses can be attributed to non-core wholesale initiatives which began in the
fourth quarter of 2000 as discussed above, which had no immediate effect on
selling, general and administrative expenses for both the wholesale and
alternative channels and small business channels and increases during 2000 to
our consumer workforce to support retail activities. Workforce reductions in
February 2001 have helped to stabilize selling, general and administrative
expenses since the second quarter of 2001.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were offset in part by foreign
currency exchange fluctuations which had the effect of reducing selling, general
and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues by approximately
one-quarter of a percentage point for both the three- and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2001.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2000 and 2001, our depreciation and amortization expense was as follows (dollars

Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2001 increased to
$1.5 billion or 17.0% of revenues from $1.2 billion or 12.3% of revenues for the
third quarter of 2000. On a year-to-date basis, this expense increased to $4.3
billion or 16.0% of revenues versus $3.6 billion or 12.1% of revenues for the
first nine months of 2000. Excluding Embratel in 2000, depreciation and
amortization would have been $1.1 billion or 12.2% of revenues for the third
quarter of 2000 and $3.2 billion or 11.9% of revenues for the first nine months
of 2000. These increases reflect additional depreciation associated with 2000
and 2001 capital expenditures as well as increased depreciation associated with
the assets acquired in the Intermedia merger.

INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for the third quarter of 2001 was $442
million or 4.9% of revenues as compared to $245 million or 2.4% of revenues for
the third quarter of 2000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001,
interest expense was $1.1 billion, or 4.1% of revenues compared to $699 million,
or 2.4% of revenues for the first nine months of 2000. Excluding Embratel in
2000, interest expense would have been $262 million or 2.9% of revenues for the
third quarter of 2000 and $731 million, or 2.7% of revenues for the first nine
months of 2000. For the three months ended September 30, 2000 and 2001,
weighted-average annual interest rates on our long-term debt, excluding Embratel
in all periods, were 7.34% and 7.43% respectively, while weighted-average levels
of borrowings were $21.2 billion and $33.0 billion, respectively. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, weighted-average annual interest rates
on our long-term debt, excluding Embratel in all periods, were 7.21% and 7.27%
respectively, while weighted-average levels of borrowings were $19.8 billion and
$29.1 billion, respectively. Interest expense for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2001 increased as a result of higher debt levels from the
May 2001 bond offering and debt acquired in the Intermedia merger.

MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSE. Miscellaneous income for the third quarter of
2001 was $107 million or 1.2% of revenues compared to $107 million or 1.1% of
revenues for the third quarter of 2000. For the nine months ended September 30,
2001, miscellaneous income was $330 million or 1.2% of revenues compared to $327
million or 1.1% of revenues for the first nine months of 2000. Miscellaneous
income includes investment income, equity in income and losses of affiliated
companies, the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates for transactions
denominated in foreign currencies, gains and losses on the sale of assets and
other non-operating items.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The effective income tax rate was 38.9% of income
before taxes for the third quarter of 2001 and 38.7% of income before taxes for
the first nine months of 2001. The 2001 rates are greater than the expected
federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the amortization of
non-deductible goodwill.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. During 2000, we adopted SAB 101, which
requires certain activation and installation fee revenues to be amortized over
the average life of the related service rather than be recognized immediately.
Costs directly related to these revenues may also be deferred and amortized over
the customer contract life. This adoption resulted in a one-time expense of $85
million, net of income tax benefit of $50 million in the first quarter of 2000.

NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. For the three months ended
September 30, 2001, we reported net income applicable to common shareholders of
$493 million as compared to $935 million for the three months ended September
30, 2000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, we reported net income
applicable to common shareholders of $1.2 billion as compared to $3.4 billion
for the nine months ended September 30, 2000.

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION RELATED TO THE WORLDCOM GROUP AND THE MCI GROUP FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Each of the WorldCom group and the MCI group includes the results of operations
shown in the combined statements of operations and the attributed assets and
liabilities shown in the combined balance sheets of the relevant group. If we
acquire interests in other businesses, we intend to attribute those assets and
any related liabilities to our WorldCom group or our MCI group in accordance
with our tracking stock policy statement. All net income and cash flows
generated by the assets will be attributed to the group to which the assets were
attributed and all net proceeds from any disposition of these assets will also
be attributed to that group.

Although we sometimes refer to such assets and liabilities as those of the
WorldCom group or the MCI group, neither of the groups is a separate legal
entity. Rather, all of the assets of a group are owned by WorldCom and holders
of the


                                       49
<PAGE>

WorldCom group stock or the MCI group stock are shareholders of WorldCom and
subject to all of the risks of an investment in WorldCom and all of its
businesses, assets and liabilities.

We intend, for so long as the WorldCom group stock and the MCI group stock
remains outstanding, to include in filings by WorldCom under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the combined financial statements of each of
the WorldCom group and the MCI group. These combined financial statements will
be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, and in the case of annual financial statements, will be audited.
These combined financial statements are not legally required under current law
or SEC regulations.

Our board of directors may at any time modify, make exceptions to, or abandon
any of the policies set forth in our tracking stock policy statement with
respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities, financing arrangements,
assets, liabilities, debt, interest and other matters, or may adopt additional
policies, in each case without shareholder approval. Our board is subject to
fiduciary duties to all of WorldCom's shareholders as one group, not to the
holders of any series of stock separately. Any changes or exceptions will be
made after a determination by our board of what is in the best interests of
WorldCom as a whole, which may be detrimental to the interests of the holders of
one series of stock. The ability to make these changes may make it difficult to
address the future of a group based on the group's past performance.

ATTRIBUTION AND ALLOCATION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES

The following is a discussion of the methods used to attribute and allocate
property and equipment, revenues, line costs, shared corporate services,
intangible assets and financing arrangements to the WorldCom group and the MCI
group.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment was attributed to the WorldCom
group and the MCI group based on specific identification consistent with the
assets necessary to support the continuing operations of the businesses
attributed to the respective groups. The balances of property and equipment
attributed to each of the groups as of September 30, 2001 are as follows:

</Table>

Under our tracking policy statement, our board of directors may reallocate
assets to the other group for fair value at any time without shareholder
approval.

REVENUES. Revenues have been attributed to the WorldCom group and the MCI group
based on specific identification of the lines of business that are attributed to
the two groups.

LINE COSTS. Allocated costs and related liabilities within this caption include
the costs of the fiber optic systems attributed to the WorldCom group and the
costs of the business voice switched services attributed to the MCI group. Line
costs which are specifically identifiable to a particular group based on usage
of the network are allocated to that group; any remaining line costs that cannot
be specifically identified are allocated between the groups using methodologies
that our management believes are reasonable, such as the total revenues
generated by each group.

SHARED CORPORATE SERVICES. A portion of our shared corporate services and
related balance sheet amounts (such as executive management, human resources,
legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, treasury, strategic planning and information
systems support) has been attributed to the WorldCom group or the MCI group
based upon identification of such services specifically benefiting such group.
Where determinations based on specific usage alone have been impractical, other
allocation methods were used, including methods based on number of employees and
the total revenues generated


                                       50
<PAGE>

by each group. Our management believes these allocation methods are equitable
and provide a reasonable estimate of the costs attributable to each group.

ALLOCATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets consist of the excess
consideration paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired by us in
business combinations accounted for under the purchase method and include
goodwill, channel rights, developed technology and tradenames. These assets have
been attributed to the respective groups based on specific identification and
where acquired companies have been divided between the WorldCom group and the
MCI group, the intangible assets have been allocated based on the respective
fair values at the date of purchase of the related operations attributed to each
group. Our management believes that this method of allocation is equitable and
provides a reasonable estimate of the intangible assets attributable to the
WorldCom group and the MCI group.

All tradenames, including the MCI tradename and the other related MCI
tradenames, have been attributed to the WorldCom group. The MCI group will be
allocated an expense, and the WorldCom group will be allocated a corresponding
decrease in costs, for the use of the MCI tradenames. For purposes of preparing
the historical financial statements for the groups, an expense of $27.5 million
per annum was allocated to the MCI group, and a corresponding decrease in costs
was allocated to the WorldCom group, in each case since the date of acquisition
of MCI, for use by the MCI group of the MCI tradenames. The charge for the next
five years will be based on the following schedule:

<Table>
<S>                                   <C>
                              2001:   $27.5 million
                              2002:   $30.0 million
                              2003:   $35.0 million
                              2004:   $40.0 million
                              2005:   $45.0 million
</Table>

Any renewal or termination of use of the MCI tradename by the MCI group will be
subject to the general policy that our board of directors will act in the best
interests of WorldCom.

Goodwill and other intangibles assigned or allocated to the WorldCom group and
the MCI group as of September 30, 2001 are as follows:

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. As of January 1, 2000, $6.0 billion of our outstanding
debt was notionally allocated to the MCI group and $18.9 billion of our debt was
notionally allocated to the WorldCom group. Our debt was allocated between the
WorldCom group and the MCI group based upon a number of factors including
estimated future cash flows and the ability to pay debt service and dividends of
each of the groups. In addition, we considered certain measures of
creditworthiness, such as coverage ratios and various tests of liquidity, in the
allocation process. Our management believes that the initial allocation is
equitable and supportable by both the WorldCom group and the MCI group. The debt
allocated to the MCI group bears interest at a rate indicative of the rate at
which the MCI group would borrow from third parties if it was a wholly owned
subsidiary of WorldCom but did not have the benefit of any guarantee by
WorldCom. Interest rates will be calculated on a quarterly basis. For purposes
of the combined historical financial statements of each of the groups, debt
allocated to the MCI group was determined to bear an interest rate equal to the
weighted-average interest rate, excluding capitalized interest, of WorldCom debt
plus 1 1/4 percent. Interest allocated to the WorldCom group reflects the
difference between our actual interest expense and the interest expense charged
to the MCI group.

Each group's debt will increase or decrease by the amount of any net cash
generated by, or required to fund, the group's operating activities, investing
activities, share repurchases and other financing activities.

As of September 30, 2001, our receivables purchase program consisted of a $3.6
billion pool of receivables in which the purchaser had an undivided interest in
$2.0 billion of those receivables. The WorldCom group was allocated $2.9 billion
of the pool and $1.7 billion of the sold receivables. The MCI group was
allocated the balance. The receivables sold were attributed principally based on
specific identification, or allocated based on total revenues. Our management
believes that this method of allocation is equitable and provides a reasonable
estimate of the receivables attributable to the groups.

WorldCom group revenues for the third quarter of 2001 were $5.5 billion versus
$5.8 billion for the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30,
2001, WorldCom group revenues were $16.0 billion versus $16.9 billion for the
prior year period. As previously indicated, during the second quarter of 2001,
we took steps to restructure our investment in Embratel which resulted in the
deconsolidation of Embratel effective January 1, 2001. Excluding


                                       52

Embratel from the 2000 periods, WorldCom group revenues for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2001 increased 11.6% and 12.2%, respectively, versus
the prior year periods.

Voice revenues for the third quarter of 2001 decreased 5.9% over the prior year
period on traffic growth of 2.2%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001,
voice revenues decreased 5.8% on traffic growth of 4.3%. The revenue decreases
were partially offset by wireless voice revenue increases of 19.1% for the third
quarter of 2001 and 47.9% for the first nine months of 2001, as customers
purchased "all-distance" voice services from us. Voice revenues include both
domestic commercial long distance and local switched revenues.

Data revenues for the third quarter of 2001 increased 18.2% over the prior year
period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, data revenues increased
18.7% over the prior year period. Data includes both commercial long distance
and local dedicated bandwidth sales. As of September 30, 2001, approximately 32%
of data revenues were derived from frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode
services, where we experienced strong demand for capacity increases across the
product set as businesses moved more of their mission-critical applications to
their own networks during the period. Additionally, we continue to experience
strong price pressure for data services in our emerging markets due to
competition and the general decline in economic condition of our customers,
which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future.

International revenues for the third quarter 2001 increased 19.5% to $761
million versus $637 million, excluding Embratel, for the third quarter of 2000.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, international revenues increased
26.8% to $2.2 billion versus $1.7 billion, excluding Embratel, for the prior
year period. Geographically, Europe grew 15.9% and Asia Pacific and other areas
grew 27.4% for the third quarter of 2001. For the first nine months of 2001,
Europe grew 16.3% and Asia Pacific and other areas grew 54.0%. These increases
were partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations that had the effect of
reducing revenues by approximately $50 million in the third quarter of 2001 and
approximately $140 million for the first nine months of 2001. Although our
retail mix is improving towards a more profitable blend of data versus voice,
and retail versus wholesale, our international business continues to experience
significant price pressure on its products.

Internet revenues for the third quarter of 2001 increased 31.5% over the prior
year period. For the first nine months of 2001, Internet revenues increased
32.2% over the prior year period. Growth was driven by demand for dedicated
circuits as business customers continue to migrate their data networks and
applications to Internet-based technologies requiring greater amounts of
bandwidth. Additionally, Internet revenues growth for the third quarter of 2001
included $29 million of Digex revenues, net of intercompany eliminations, as a
result of the Intermedia merger. During 2001, we began to introduce our new
managed hosting products and virtual private networks on public and shared
environments. These products, which are in the initial phases of their life
cycle, should gradually contribute to our revenue growth over the next several
quarters. Internet revenues include dedicated Internet access, managed
networking services and applications (such as virtual private networks), web
hosting and electronic commerce and transaction services (such as web centers
and credit card transaction processing).

LINE COSTS. Line costs as a percentage of revenues for the third quarter of 2001
increased to 38.0% as compared to 37.8% reported for the third quarter of 2000.
On a year-to-date basis, line costs as a percentage of revenues was 38.1% as
compared to 37.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2000. Excluding
Embratel in 2000, line costs would have been $1.8 billion, or 36.1% of revenues
for the third quarter of 2000 and $5.2 billion, or 36.3% of revenues for the
first nine months of 2000. The increases as a percentage of revenues reflect the
pricing pressure in the data, international and Internet markets. Beginning in
the fourth quarter of 2000, pricing pressure began to stabilize as a result of
our actions to improve gross margins. Line costs were partially offset by
foreign currency exchange fluctuations which had the effect of reducing line
costs as a percentage of revenues by less than one percentage point for both the
three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2001, and by increased data
and dedicated Internet traffic over our own facilities, which positively
affected line costs as a percentage of revenues by less than one percentage
point for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2001.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. Selling, general and administrative
expenses for the third quarter of 2001 were $1.3 billion or 23.9% of revenues as
compared to $1.7 billion or 28.5% of revenues for the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2000
includes a $340 million pre-tax charge associated with specific domestic and
international wholesale accounts that were deemed uncollectible due to
bankruptcies, litigation and settlements of contractual disputes that occurred
in the third quarter of 2000. Excluding these charges and Embratel in 2000,
selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2000 would
have been 22.1% of revenues.

On a year-to-date basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.7
billion or 29.4% of revenues as compared to $4.2 billion or 24.9% of revenues
for the first nine months of 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses
for the first nine months of 2001 includes pre-tax costs of $742 million related
to the write-off of investments in certain publicly traded and privately held
companies, $12 million as a result of the costs associated with the tracking
stock capitalization and $77 million associated with domestic severance packages
and other costs related to our February 2001 workforce reductions. Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2000
also includes a $93 million pre-tax one-time charge associated with the
termination of the Sprint Corporation merger agreement in addition to the charge
for uncollectible accounts discussed above. Excluding these charges and Embratel
in 2000, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
revenues would have been 24.2% for the first nine months of 2001 versus 22.0%
for the first nine months of 2000.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2001, include increased costs associated with "generation d"
initiatives that include product marketing, customer care, information system
and product development, employee retention costs, and costs associated with
multichannel multipoint distribution service product development.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were offset in part by foreign
currency exchange fluctuations which had the effect of reducing selling, general
and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues by less than one-half of
a percentage point for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2001.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization expense for the
third quarter of 2001 increased to $1.1 billion or 19.8% of revenues from $834
million or 14.3% of revenues for the prior year period. On a year-to-date basis,
depreciation increased to $3.0 billion, or 18.4% of revenues as compared to $2.4
billion, or 14.1% of revenues for the first nine months of 2000. Excluding
Embratel in 2000, depreciation and amortization would have been $710 million or
14.5% of revenues for the third quarter of 2000 and $2.0 billion or 14.2% of
revenues for the first nine months of 2000. These increases reflect increased
depreciation associated with 2000 and 2001 capital expenditures as well as
increased depreciation associated with the assets acquired in the Intermedia
merger.

INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for the third quarter of 2001 was $316
million or 5.8% of revenues as compared to $118 million or 2.0% of revenues for
the third quarter of 2000. On a year-to-date basis, interest expense was $717
million, or 4.5% of revenues as compared to $318 million, or 1.9% of revenues
for the first nine months of 2000. Excluding Embratel in 2000, interest expense
would have been $135 million, or 2.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2000
and $350 million, or 2.4% of revenues for the first nine months of 2000.
Interest expense on borrowings incurred by WorldCom and allocated to the
WorldCom group reflects the difference between WorldCom's actual interest
expense and the interest expense allocated to the MCI group. The MCI group was
allocated interest based on the weighted-average interest rate, excluding
capitalized interest, of WorldCom debt plus 1 1/4 percent.

MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSE. Miscellaneous income for the third quarter of
2001 was $107 million, or 2.0% of revenues as compared to $107 million, or 1.8%
of revenues for the third quarter of 2000. On a year-to-date basis,
miscellaneous income was $330 million, or 2.1% of revenues as compared to $327
million, or 1.9% of revenues for the first nine months of 2000. Miscellaneous
income includes investment income, equity in income and losses of affiliated
companies, the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates for transactions
denominated in foreign currencies, gains and losses on the sale of assets and
other non-operating items.


                                       54

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The effective income tax rate was 38.9% of income
before taxes for the third quarter of 2001 and 38.7% of income before taxes for
the first nine months of 2001. The 2001 rates are greater than the expected
federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the amortization of
non-deductible goodwill.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. During 2000, we adopted SAB 101, which
requires certain activation and installation fee revenues to be amortized over
the average life of the related service rather than be recognized immediately.
Costs directly related to these revenues may also be deferred and amortized over
the customer contract life. This adoption resulted in a one-time expense of $75
million, net of income tax benefit of $43 million, for the WorldCom group in the
first quarter of 2000.

NET INCOME. For the three months ended September 30, 2001, the WorldCom group
reported net income of $460 million as compared to $583 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2000. Pro forma diluted income per common share for
the third quarter of 2001 was $0.16 compared to income per common share of $0.20
for the third quarter of 2000. On a year-to-date basis, pro forma diluted income
per common share was $0.38 as compared to $0.67 for the first nine months of
2000. Pro forma diluted income per share assumes the recapitalization occurred
at the beginning of 2000 and that the WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock
existed for all periods presented.

     THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001

REVENUES. Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2001 decreased 16.9%
to $3.5 billion versus $4.2 billion for the prior year period. The decrease in
total revenues is primarily attributable to consumers' substitution of wire line
services with wireless and e-mail, and proactive revenue initiatives resulting
in services being de-emphasized as we shift the MCI group's focus from revenue
growth to cash generation.

Actual reported revenues by category for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2000 and 2001 reflect the following changes by category (dollars

Consumer revenues for the third quarter of 2001 decreased 5.8% over the prior
year period. For the first nine months of 2001, consumer revenues decreased 6.3%
over the prior year period. The majority of this decrease is attributed to
decreases in calling card, dial around and dial-1 revenues as a result of
consumers' substitution of wire line services with wireless and e-mail. Our
consumer local initiatives continue to perform well as consumer local revenues
increased over 200% for the third quarter of 2001 and over 175% for the first
nine months of 2001 versus the prior year period.

Wholesale revenues for the third quarter of 2001 decreased 22.4% over the prior
year period. For the first nine months of 2001, wholesale revenues decreased
22.8%. The wholesale market continues to be extremely price competitive,
although rate per minute began to stabilize in the second quarter of 2001.
Wholesale revenues during the past year were also impacted by proactive revenue
initiatives, which were made to improve the quality of the wholesale revenue
stream as we shift the MCI group's focus from revenue growth to cash generation.

Alternative channels and small business revenues for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2001 decreased 38.1% and 32.1%, respectively, over the prior
year periods. Alternative channels and small business includes sales agents and
affiliates, wholesale alternative channels, small business, prepaid calling card
and wireless messaging revenues. These decreases are attributed to pricing
pressures in the wholesale and small business markets which negatively affected
revenue growth and gross margins in this area, and proactive initiatives to
de-emphasize services with unacceptable gross margins as we shift the MCI
group's focus from revenue growth to cash generation.

Dial-up Internet revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001
decreased 9.9% and 2.7%, respectively, over the prior year amounts. Our dial
access network has grown 28% to approximately 3.2 million modems as of September
30, 2001, compared with the prior year period. Additionally, Internet connect
hours increased 13.6% to 5.4 billion hours for the first nine months of 2001
versus the prior year. These network usage increases were more than offset by
pricing pressure resulting from the impact of volume discounts and off-net
traffic, which lowered average revenue per hour by approximately 16% for the
third quarter of 2001 and 18% for the first nine months of 2001 versus the prior
year periods.

LINE COSTS. Line costs as a percentage of revenues for the third quarter of 2001
increased to 50.9% as compared to 42.4% reported for the prior year period. On a
year-to-date basis, line costs as a percentage of revenues increased to 50.8% of
revenues as compared to 42.3% for the first nine months of 2000. These increases
were primarily the result of continued competitive pricing on the dial-up
Internet business as noted above, which resulted in a modest increase in average
cost per hour while average dial-up Internet revenues per hour decreased by 16%
for the third quarter of 2001 and 18% for the first nine months of 2001.
Additionally, line costs as a percentage of revenues increased as a result of
the decrease in higher margin calling card and dial around revenues due to
wireless substitution as noted above.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. Selling, general and administrative
expenses for the third quarter of 2001 were $1.3 billion or 37.1% of revenues as
compared to $1.5 billion or 35.1% of revenues for the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2000
includes a $345 million pre-tax charge associated with specific wholesale
accounts that were deemed uncollectible due to bankruptcies, litigation and
settlements of contractual disputes that occurred in the third quarter of 2000.
Excluding these charges, selling, general and administrative expenses for the
third quarter of 2000 would have been 26.9%.

On a year-to-date basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.1
billion, or 38.1% of revenues as compared to $3.8 billion or 30.5% of revenues
for the first nine months of 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 includes pre-tax costs of $123
million related to the write-off of investments in certain publicly traded and
privately held companies, $11 million as a result of the costs associated with
the tracking stock capitalization and $48 million associated with domestic
severance packages and other costs related to our February 2001 workforce
reductions. Excluding these costs, selling, general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of revenues were 36.4% for the first nine months of 2001 versus
27.7% for the prior year period, after excluding the charge for uncollectible
accounts discussed above.


                                       56
<PAGE>

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses can be attributed
to non-core wholesale initiatives which began in the fourth quarter of 2000 as
discussed above, which had no immediate effect on selling, general and
administrative expenses for both the wholesale and alternative channels and
small business channels and increases during 2000 to our consumer workforce to
support retail activities. Workforce reductions in February 2001 have helped to
stabilize selling, general and administrative expenses since the second quarter
of 2001.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization expense for the
third quarter of 2001 increased to $236 million or 6.8% of revenues from $231
million or 5.5% of revenues for the same period in the prior year. On a
year-to-date basis, depreciation increased to $700 million, or 6.6% of revenues
as compared to $654 million, or 5.2% of revenues for the first nine months of
2000. These increases primarily reflect additional depreciation associated with
2000 and 2001 capital expenditures.

INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for the third quarter of 2001 was $126
million or 3.6% of revenues as compared to $127 million or 3.0% of revenues for
the same period in 2000. On a year-to-date basis, interest expense was $378
million, or 3.5% of revenues as compared to $381 million, or 3.0% of revenues
for the first nine months of 2000. Interest expense on borrowings incurred by
WorldCom and allocated to the MCI group was based on the weighted-average
interest rate, excluding capitalized interest, of WorldCom debt plus 11/4
percent. As of January 1, 2000, $6.0 billion of WorldCom's outstanding debt was
notionally allocated to the MCI group. During 2001, the MCI group repaid $408
million of the notionally allocated debt and as of September 30, 2001 the MCI
group's long-term debt balance was $5.6 billion.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The effective income tax rate was 40% of income
before taxes for the third quarter of 2001 and 38.9% of income before taxes for
the first nine months of 2001. The 2001 rates are greater than the expected
federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the amortization of
non-deductible goodwill.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. During 2000, we adopted SAB 101, which
requires certain activation and installation fee revenues to be amortized over
the average life of the related service rather than be recognized immediately.
Costs directly related to these revenues may also be deferred and amortized over
the customer contract life. This adoption resulted in a one-time expense of $10
million, net of income tax benefit of $7 million for the MCI group in the first
quarter of 2000.

NET INCOME. For the three months ended September 30, 2001, the MCI group
reported net income of $33 million as compared to net income of $352 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2000. Pro forma diluted income per common
share for the third quarter of 2001 was $0.28 compared to income per common
share of $3.06 for the third quarter of 2000. On a year-to-date basis, pro forma
diluted income per common share was $0.56 as compared to $12.43 for the first
nine months of 2000. Pro forma diluted income per share assumes the
recapitalization occurred at the beginning of 2000 and that the WorldCom group
stock and MCI group stock existed for all periods presented.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of September 30, 2001, our total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was
$28.7 billion. Additionally, at September 30, 2001, we had available liquidity
of $10.5 billion under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and
cash on hand.

As of January 1, 2000, the MCI group was notionally allocated $6.0 billion of
WorldCom's debt and the remaining outstanding debt was notionally allocated to
the WorldCom group. WorldCom management has a wide degree of discretion over the
cash management policies of both the WorldCom group and the MCI group. Cash
generated by either group can be transferred to the other group without prior
approval of WorldCom's shareholders. Due to the discretion possessed by
management over the cash management policies of both groups, including the
timing and decision of whether to finance capital expenditures, it may be
difficult to assess each group's liquidity and capital resource needs, and, in
turn, the future prospects of each group based on past performance. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2001, the MCI group generated sufficient cash to
repay $408 million of its allocated notional debt.

On June 8, 2001, we replaced our existing $7 billion 364-Day Revolving Credit
and Term Loan Agreement with two new credit facilities consisting of a $2.65
billion 364-Day Facility, and a $1.6 billion Multi-Year Facility. The 364-Day
Facility and the Multi-Year Facility, together with our $3.75 billion Existing
Facility, provide us with aggregate credit facilities of $8 billion. These
credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program and
for other general corporate purposes.

The Existing Facility and the Multi-Year Facility mature on June 30, 2002 and
June 8, 2006, respectively. The 364-Day Facility has a 364-day term, which may
be extended for successive 364-day terms to the extent of the committed amounts
from those lenders consenting thereto, with a requirement that lenders holding
51% of the committed amounts consent and so long as the final maturity date does
not extend beyond June 8, 2006. Additionally, we may elect to convert the
principal debt outstanding under the 364-Day Facility to a term loan maturing no
later than one year after the conversion date, so long as the final maturity
date does not extend beyond June 8, 2006. The Existing Facility is subject to
annual commitment fees not to exceed 0.25% of any unborrowed portion of the
facilities. The 364-Day Facility and the Multi-Year Facility are subject to
annual facility fees not to exceed 0.20% or 0.25%, respectively, of the average
daily commitment under each such facility (whether used or unused).

The credit facilities bear interest payable in varying periods, depending on the
interest period, not to exceed six months, or with respect to any Eurodollar
Rate borrowing, 12 months if available to all lenders, at rates selected by us
under the terms of the credit facilities, including a Base Rate or Eurodollar
Rate, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for the Eurodollar Rate
borrowing generally varies from 0.35% to 0.75% as to loans under the Existing
Facility, from 0.29% to 0.80% as to loans under the 364-Day Facility and 0.27%
to 0.75% as to loans under the Multi-Year Facility, in each case based upon our
then current debt ratings. The credit facilities are unsecured but include a
negative pledge of our assets and, subject to exceptions, the covered
subsidiaries.

The credit facilities require compliance with a financial covenant based on the
ratio of total debt to total capitalization, calculated on a consolidated basis.
The credit facilities require compliance with operating covenants which limit,
among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us and the
covered subsidiaries and sales of assets and mergers and dissolutions. The
credit facilities do not restrict distributions to shareholders, provided we are
not in default under the credit facilities. As of the date of this filing, we
were in compliance with these covenants.

On May 9, 2001, we completed the pricing of a public debt offering of
approximately $11.9 billion principal amount of debt securities, based on
currency exchange rates on May 8, 2001. The net proceeds of $11.7 billion have
been or will be used for general corporate purposes, including to repay
commercial paper, and repayment of $1.5 billion of our 6.125% notes due August
15, 2001 and $1.5 billion of our floating rate notes due November 26, 2001. The
public debt offering consisted of the following series of notes:

All of the notes, except for the 6.50% Notes due 2004 are redeemable, as a whole
or in part, at our option, at any time or from time to time, at respective
redemption prices equal to:

In the case of the U.S. dollar notes, the greater of:

      o     100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and
      o     the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments,
            as defined therein, discounted, on a semiannual basis, assuming a
            360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury
            Rate, as defined therein, plus:
            o     30 basis points for the Notes due 2011, and
            o     35 basis points for the Notes due 2031;

In the case of the euro notes, the greater of:

      o     100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and
      o     the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments,
            as defined therein, discounted, on an annual basis (based on the
            actual number of days elapsed divided by 365 or 366, as the case may
            be), at the Reference Euro Dealer Rate, as defined therein, plus 25
            basis points; and

In the case of the sterling notes, the greater of:

      o     100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed and
      o     the price expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal
            places, with .0005 being rounded up) at which the Gross Redemption
            Yield, as defined therein, on the outstanding principal amount of
            the notes on the Reference Date, as defined therein, is equal to the
            Gross Redemption Yield (determined by reference to the middle-market
            price) at 3:00 p.m. (London time) on that date on the Benchmark
            Gilt, as defined therein, plus 25 basis points;

plus, in the case of the U.S. dollar notes, the euro notes and the sterling
notes, accrued interest to the date of redemption which has not been paid.

In connection with the Intermedia merger, we assumed Intermedia's outstanding
debt including $1.2 billion of senior discount notes with interest rates ranging
from 11.25% to 12.5%, $0.9 billion of senior notes with interest rates ranging
from 8.5% to 9.5%, credit facility borrowings of $258 million and other
long-term debt including capital leases of $0.6 billion. We repaid the
Intermedia credit facility borrowings of $258 million and subsequently
terminated Intermedia's credit facility during the third quarter of 2001.
Additionally, on September 28, 2001, we redeemed all of Intermedia's 12.5%
senior discount notes for $337 million. Cash balances were used to pay all
amounts under the Intermedia credit facility and Intermedia 12.5% senior
discount notes.

During the third quarter of 2001, $1.5 billion of 6.125% senior notes matured,
we redeemed all of our outstanding 8.875% senior notes due 2006 for $694
million, we retired $1.1 billion of our outstanding debt through open market
debt repurchases (including $481 million of outstanding debt assumed in the
Intermedia merger) and we redeemed all of our outstanding Series G preferred
stock at par for $200 million. Cash balances were used to repay these amounts.

The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 versus the prior year
amount reflects increases in working capital requirements combined with lower
operating results in both the WorldCom group and the MCI group.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

For the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, our net cash used in
investing activities was as follows (dollars in millions):

</Table>

The WorldCom group's primary capital expenditures totaled $8.4 billion in the
first nine months of 2000 and $5.9 billion in the first nine months of 2001.
Primary capital expenditures include purchases of transmission, communications
and other equipment. The MCI group's capital expenditures totaled $370 million
in the first nine months of 2000 and $188 million in the first nine months of
2001. The MCI group's capital expenditures include purchases of switching
equipment, dial modems and messaging and other equipment.

Investing activities include acquisitions and related costs at the WorldCom
group of $14 million and $167 million in the first nine months of 2000 and 2001,
respectively.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

For the nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 2001, cash provided by
financing activities was as follows (dollars in millions):

     Net cash provided by financing activities        $ 4,704         $ 3,644
                                                      =======         =======
</Table>

Financing activities include net proceeds from borrowings on debt of $4.5
billion and $4.1 billion for the first nine months of 2000 and 2001,
respectively. Financing activities for the MCI group reflect the repayments of
intergroup advances and repayment of notionally allocated debt from WorldCom.


                                       60
<PAGE>

Also included in financing activities are proceeds from WorldCom's common stock
issuances of $551 million and $112 million in the first nine months of 2000 and
2001, respectively, as a result of WorldCom common stock option and warrant
exercises.

Dividends paid in the first nine months of 2000 and 2001 were $49 million and
$58 million, respectively. The increase represents dividends associated with our
Series D, E, F and G preferred stock which was issued in connection with the
Intermedia merger.

On August 20, 2001 the holder of our Series G preferred stock exercised its
right to require us to redeem all of the outstanding Series G preferred stock at
par for $200 million. Additionally, in January 2000, we redeemed all of our
outstanding Series C preferred stock for $190 million.

In October 2001, we exercised our option to redeem all of our outstanding Series
B Preferred Stock. Prior to the redemption date, substantially all of the
holders of our Series B Preferred Stock elected to convert the preferred stock
into 0.1460868 shares of WorldCom group stock and 0.005843472 shares of MCI
group stock for each share of Series B Preferred Stock held.

During the second quarter of 2001, we declared the first quarterly dividend for
the MCI group common stock. A cash dividend of $0.60 per share of MCI group
common stock, or approximately $70 million in the aggregate, was paid on October
15, 2001 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 28,
2001. During the third quarter of 2001, we declared the fourth quarter dividend
of $0.60 per share of MCI group common stock to be paid on January 15, 2002 to
shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2001.

We believe that we will generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and
capital requirements; however, economic downturns and other adverse
developments, including factors beyond our control, could impair our ability to
service our indebtedness. In addition, the cash flow required to service our
debt may reduce our ability to fund internal growth, additional acquisitions and
capital improvements.

We believe that the Intermedia merger should support our web hosting expansion
by providing a comprehensive portfolio of hosting products and services for
mid-sized and large businesses. This will allow us to accelerate our ability to
provide managed web and application hosting services by 12 to 18 months.
Additionally, we expect that Digex will continue to build its operations and its
plan to expand its customer base, causing it to continue to incur operating
losses for the foreseeable future, which could adversely affect our results of
operations.

The development of our businesses and the installation and expansion of our
domestic and international networks will continue to require significant capital
expenditures. We anticipate that such capital expenditures will be approximately
$7.5 billion to $8.0 billion in 2001 for the WorldCom group, and approximately
$500 million for the MCI group. For 2002, we anticipate capital expenditures to
be $5.5 billion for the WorldCom group and $500 million for MCI group.

Absent significant capital requirements for acquisitions, we believe that cash
flow from operations and available liquidity, including our credit facilities
and commercial paper program and available cash will be sufficient to meet our
capital needs for the next twelve months.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 "Business Combinations" and SFAS No.
142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, which includes the Intermedia
merger, to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens
the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill. Recorded
goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against this new criteria and may
result in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill, or alternatively,
amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and
recognized apart from goodwill. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible
assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to annual impairment tests. The statement includes provisions for the
identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future
impairments of goodwill. Goodwill and other intangibles, acquired prior to July
1, 2001, will continue to be amortized


                                       61
<PAGE>

until the adoption of the statement on January 1, 2002. Upon adoption, we will
stop amortizing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, including
goodwill and tradenames. Based on current levels of such assets, this would
reduce amortization expense by approximately $1.3 billion annually ($1.0 billion
at WorldCom group and $0.3 billion at MCI group). Additionally, we are
conducting impairment reviews of all intangibles assets with indefinite useful
lives and we expect to complete this assessment no later than the second quarter
of 2002, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 "Asset Retirement Obligations," which
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets. The fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
with the cost capitalized as part of the related long-lived assets and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. SFAS No. 143
must be adopted by 2003. We have not yet quantified the impact of adopting SFAS
No. 143 on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which supercedes both SFAS No. 121 "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment
of a business contained in APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of
Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." SFAS
No. 144 establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations.
The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are effective beginning in 2002 and are not
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or
financial position.

EURO CONVERSION

On January 1, 1999, 11 out of the 15 member countries of the European Union
established the euro, a new common currency for member countries, and fixed
conversion rates between their existing currencies and the euro. The transition
period for the introduction of the euro is between January 1, 1999 to December
31, 2001. We are establishing plans to address the many issues involved with the
introduction of the euro, including the conversion of information technology
systems, recalculating currency risk, recalibrating derivatives and other
financial instruments, assessing strategies concerning continuity of contracts,
and refining the processes for preparing taxation and accounting records. At
this time, we have not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue.
We believe that our business will potentially be affected by the impact of
increased price transparency, however, we expect to be able to maintain our
margins across our international operations as a result of any pricing changes
that we decide to make purely as a result of the euro transition.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency
fluctuations and changes in market values of our investments.

Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed
and variable rate debt. We typically do not use derivative financial instruments
to manage our interest rate risk. We have minimal cash flow exposure due to
general interest rate changes for our fixed rate, long-term debt obligations. We
do not believe a hypothetical 10% adverse rate change in our variable rate debt
obligations would be material to our results of operations.

We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk primarily due to other
international operation's holding of approximately $509 million in U.S. dollar
denominated debt, and our holding of approximately $1.9 billion of indebtedness
indexed in other foreign currencies including the Euro and Sterling Pound as of
September 30, 2001. Our potential immediate loss that would result from a
hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on this
position would be approximately $212 million. In addition, if that change were
to be sustained, our cost of financing would increase in proportion to the
change.

We are also subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our
international operations which use a foreign currency as their functional
currency and are translated into U.S. dollars.


                                       62
<PAGE>

We believe our market risk exposure with regard to our marketable equity
securities is limited to changes in quoted market prices for the securities.
Based upon the composition of our marketable equity securities at September 30,
2001, we do not believe a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted market
prices would be material to our results of operations or financial position.
