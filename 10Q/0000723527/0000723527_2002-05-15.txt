                         WORLDCOM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(A) GENERAL

The consolidated financial statements included herein, are unaudited and have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States for interim financial reporting and SEC regulations. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations. In the opinion of our management, the financial statements reflect
all adjustments (of a normal and recurring nature) which are necessary to
present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the interim periods. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. The
results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2002 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2002.

(B)  EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our consolidated financial statements present basic and diluted earnings per
share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock using the two-class method.
The two-class method is an earnings formula that determines the attributed
earnings per share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock according to
participation rights in undistributed earnings. The combined financial
statements of the WorldCom group and the MCI group do not separately present
earnings per share because WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock are series
of our common stock, and the WorldCom group and the MCI group are not legal
entities with a capital structure.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the
basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the WorldCom group and the
MCI group for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002 (in millions,
except per share data):

(E)  SEGMENT INFORMATION

Based on our organizational structure, we operate in six reportable segments:
Commercial voice, data and Internet; International operations; Consumer;
Wholesale; Alternative channels and small business; and Dial-up Internet. Our
reportable segments represent business units that primarily offer similar
products and services; however, the business units are managed separately due to
the type and class of customer as well as the geographic dispersion of their
operations. The Commercial voice, data and Internet segment includes voice, data
and other types of domestic communications services for commercial customers,
and Internet services including dedicated access and web and application hosting
services. International operations provide voice, data, Internet and other
similar types of communications services to customers primarily in Europe and
the Asia Pacific region. Consumer includes domestic voice communications
services for consumer customers. Wholesale includes long distance voice and data
domestic communications services for wholesale customers. Alternative channels
and small business includes domestic long distance voice and data, agents,
prepaid calling cards and paging services provided to alternative wholesale and
small business customers. Dial-up Internet includes dial-up Internet access
services.

Our chief operating decision-maker utilizes revenue information in assessing
performance and making overall operating decisions and resource allocations.
Communications services are generally provided utilizing our fiber optic
networks, which do not make a distinction between the types of services
provided. Profit and loss information


                                       7

for WorldCom, the WorldCom group and the MCI group is reported only on a
consolidated basis to the chief operating decision-maker and our board of
directors.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same policies as those used by
us in preparing our consolidated financial statements set forth in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. Information about our
segments for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, is as follows (in

(F)  CONTINGENCIES

We are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to our
business and have included loss contingencies in other current liabilities and
other liabilities for these matters in our financial statements. In some
instances, rulings by federal, state and international regulatory authorities
may result in increased operating costs to us. The results of these various
legal and regulatory matters are uncertain and could have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

REGULATION. We are subject to varying degrees of federal, state, local and
international regulation. In the United States, our subsidiaries are most
heavily regulated by the states, especially for the provision of local exchange
services. Our subsidiaries must be certified separately in each state to offer
local exchange and intrastate long distance services. No state, however,
subjects us to rate of return regulation, nor are we currently required to
obtain FCC authorization for installation or operation of our network facilities
used for domestic services, other than licenses for specific multichannel
multipoint distribution services, wireless communications service and
terrestrial microwave and satellite earth station facilities that utilize radio
frequency spectrum. FCC approval is required, however, for the installation and
operation of our international facilities and services. We are subject to
varying degrees of regulation in the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct
business, including authorization for the installation and operation of network
facilities. Although the trend in federal, state and international regulation
appears to favor increased competition, no assurance can be given that changes
in current or future regulations adopted by the FCC, state or foreign regulators
or legislative initiatives in the United States or abroad would not have a
material adverse effect on us.

In August 1996, the FCC established nationwide rules pursuant to the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, or the Telecom Act, designed to encourage new
entrants to compete in local service markets through interconnection with the
traditional local phone companies, resale of traditional local phone companies'
retail services, and use of individual and combinations of unbundled network
elements, provided by the traditional local phone companies. Unbundled network
elements are defined in the Telecom Act as any "facility or equipment used in
the provision of a telecommunication service," as well as "features, function,
and capabilities that are provided by means of such facility or equipment." In
January 1999, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the FCC's
authority to issue the rules, including a pricing methodology for unbundled
network elements. On remand, the FCC clarified the requirement that traditional
local phone companies make specific unbundled network elements available to new
entrants. The traditional local phone companies appealed the decision to the
United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Oral argument was held
March 7, 2002.

In its January 1999 decision, the Supreme Court remanded to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit various substantive questions concerning
the FCC's rules for pricing unbundled network elements. In July


                                       8
<Page>

2000, the Eighth Circuit upheld the use of a forward-looking methodology but
struck down the portion of the rule that calculates costs based on efficient
technology and design choices. At the request of various parties, including
us, the Supreme Court reviewed the Eighth Circuit's decision. On May 13,
2002, the Supreme Court upheld the FCC's pricing rules in their entirety,
including the portion that calculates costs.

Numerous other issues related to the list of available unbundled network
elements are under active consideration at the FCC or in the courts. In December
2001, the FCC began an examination of whether certain high capacity and
broadband services offered by traditional phone companies were subject to
sufficient competition such that they no longer needed to be regulated as
"dominant". In February 2002, the FCC initiated a proceeding seeking to
streamline and simplify the unbundled network element requirements imposed on
traditional local phone companies in its "Triennial Review" of its local
competition rules. In a separate proceeding, the FCC is examining whether
broadband Internet access, or "DSL service" provided by traditional telephone
companies should be treated as an information service and not subject to common
carrier unbundling requirements. On March 7, 2002, the D.C. Circuit heard oral
argument in a case that will determine whether traditional phone companies must
unbundle the voice portion of a DSL connection. The FCC may begin to resolve
these proceedings in the fourth quarter of 2002. If regulations are streamlined
or removed, there are elements and combinations of elements upon which WorldCom
relies to provide local services, broadband and advanced services that might no
longer be required as a matter of federal regulation. Substantial reduction in
unbundling requirements for traditional phone companies would also foreclose
WorldCom's future range of options in provisioning local service to customers.

The Telecom Act requires traditional local phone companies to petition the FCC
for permission to offer long distance services for each state within their
region. Under section 271 of the Telecom Act, for these applications to be
granted, the FCC must find, among other things, that the traditional phone
company has demonstrated that it has satisfied a 14-point competitive checklist
to open its local network to competition and that granting the petition is in
the public interest. To date, the FCC has rejected five traditional local phone
company applications and it has granted eleven: Verizon's for New York,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont and SBC's
for Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas. WorldCom and other
competitive carriers appealed to the D.C. Circuit the approvals for Kansas,
Oklahoma and Massachusetts. On December 28, 2001, the D.C. Circuit decided that
the FCC had not adequately addressed whether the prices charged for leasing
network elements by SBC in Kansas and Oklahoma create a price squeeze which
violated the standards for SBC to gain long distance approval. Without vacating
the approval, the D.C. Circuit remanded the case to the FCC for it to address
the price squeeze issue. In the Massachusetts appeal, oral argument is scheduled
for September 9, 2002. BellSouth has filed applications to offer long distance
service for Georgia and Louisiana, and Verizon has filed applications for New
Jersey and Maine. Other applications may be filed at any time. We have
challenged, and will continue to challenge, any application that we believe does
not satisfy the requirements of section 271 or the FCC's local competition
rules. To date, these challenges have focused on the pricing of unbundled
network elements and on the adequacy of the traditional local phone companies'
operations support systems.

In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that would have the
effect of allowing traditional local phone companies to offer in-region long
distance data services without satisfying section 271 of the Telecom Act and/or
of making it more difficult for competitors to resell incumbent local phone
company high-speed Internet access services or to lease the unbundled network
elements used to provide these services. This legislation passed the House of
Representatives on February 27, 2002 and has been referred to the Senate
Commerce Committee.

In February 1999, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling and Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking regarding the regulatory treatment of calls to Internet service
providers. Prior to the FCC's order, over thirty state public utility
commissions issued orders finding that carriers, including us, are entitled to
collect reciprocal compensation for completing calls to Internet service
providers under the terms of their interconnection agreements with traditional
local phone companies. Many of these public utility commission decisions were
appealed by the traditional local phone companies and, since the FCC's order,
many traditional local phone companies have filed new cases at the public
utility commissions or in court. We petitioned for review of the FCC's order in
the D.C. Circuit, which vacated the order and remanded the case to the FCC for
further proceedings. In April 2001, the FCC issued an Order on Remand and Report
and Order asserting jurisdiction over calls to Internet service providers and
establishing a three-year transitional scheme of decreasing reciprocal
compensation rates. We filed a petition for review of the FCC's order with the
D.C. Circuit, and on May 3, 2002, the D.C. Circuit upheld our challenge and
remanded the case to the FCC, ruling that the FCC's legal analysis was based on
a flawed reading of the Telecom Act. The Court expressly declined to decide any
of the remaining challenges


                                       9

to the transitional scheme, opting to wait until the FCC provided a sufficient
legal basis in support of the conclusions it had reached in the Order. In the
interim, however, because the Court apparently believed that there may be other
legal basis for adopting the rules chosen here, it decided not to vacate the
Order and instead left the FCC transitional scheme in place.

It is possible that spectrum rights held may be disrupted by FCC decisions to
re-allocate some or all of that spectrum to other services. If this
re-allocation were to occur, we cannot predict whether current deployment plans
for our multi-channel multipoint distribution services will be sustainable.

LITIGATION. In November 2000, class action complaints were filed in the United
States District Courts for the Southern District of Mississippi, the Southern
District of New York, and the District of Columbia against WorldCom and some of
our executive officers. All of these actions were consolidated in the Southern
District of Mississippi on March 27, 2001, along with another purported class
action lawsuit filed on behalf of individuals who purchased stock in Intermedia
between September 5 and November 1, 2000, which action asserted substantially
similar claims and alleges that after the announcement of the
WorldCom-Intermedia merger, the price of Intermedia stock was tied to the price
of WorldCom stock. On June 1, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended
complaint. Among other things, the consolidated amended complaint alleged that
statements regarding WorldCom's revenues, the integration of MCI, the success of
UUNET Technologies, and the expansion of WorldCom's network were false;
WorldCom's financial disclosures were false; and WorldCom's announcement of its
"generation d" initiative was misleading. Based on these allegations, the
consolidated amended complaint asserts claims for violation of Section 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and
Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The consolidated amended
complaint seeks to certify a class of persons who purchased WorldCom shares
between February 10, 2000 and November 1, 2000, inclusive; it does not assert
separate claims on behalf of purchasers of Intermedia shares. On March 29, 2002,
the district court granted the motion to dismiss the consolidated amended
complaint filed by WorldCom and the individual defendants, and it entered final
judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice. On April 4, 2002, plaintiffs
filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We
believe that the consolidated amended complaint and the notice of appeal are
without merit and will continue to defend them vigorously.

Complaints dated April 30, 2002 and May 3, 2002, purportedly made on behalf
of a class of WorldCom shareholders, were filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints, which name as
defendants WorldCom, various officers and directors, and our auditors, allege
that the defendants failed to properly account for goodwill and other
intangible assets in connection with numerous acquisitions. One of the
actions also alleges pendent state law claims. We believe the factual
allegations and legal claims asserted in these complaints are without merit
and will defend them vigorously.

On March 18, 2002, a current and a former employee filed suit in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California against WorldCom
and certain of its executive officers claiming that they breached their
fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act with respect to
the administration of the WorldCom 401(k) Plan. Among other things, they allege
that the defendants misrepresented and/or concealed WorldCom's revenue,
cashflow, earnings and the reason(s) for its change in financial performance.
They further allege that the defendants knowingly participated in and/or
concealed these alleged acts or omissions while continuing to direct the
purchase and retention of WorldCom stock by the WorldCom 401(k) Plan. The
complaint seeks to certify a class of persons who participated in the WorldCom
401(k) Plan for the period of February 8, 2000 to November 1, 2000, and requests
damages and other relief. We believe the factual allegations and legal claims
asserted in the complaint are without merit and will defend them vigorously.

In August 1997, three complaints were filed in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia, as class actions on behalf of purchasers of MCI
shares. The three cases were consolidated on April 1, 1998. On or about May 8,
1998, the plaintiffs in all three cases filed a consolidated amended complaint
alleging, on behalf of purchasers of MCI's shares between July 11, 1997 and
August 21, 1997, inclusive, that MCI and some of its officers and directors
failed to disclose material information about MCI, including that MCI was
renegotiating the terms of the MCI BT merger agreement. The consolidated amended
complaint seeks damages and other relief. WorldCom and the other defendants have
moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.

(G)  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets", or SFAS No. 142, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized
but are subject to annual impairment tests. The statement also includes
provisions for the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing
potential future impairments of goodwill. Upon adoption, we stopped amortizing
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, including goodwill and
tradenames. Additionally, we made no revisions to the assigned useful lives of
intangible assets that continue to be amortized. We are conducting impairment
reviews of all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and we expect to
complete this assessment no later than the second quarter of 2002, in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Based on our preliminary analyses, we
estimate that as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we will reduce
goodwill by $15 to $20 billion.

Our earnings and earnings per share information for the three months ended March
31, 2001, adjusted to exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives, is as follows (in millions, except per
share amounts):

(H)  CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION

Below is the consolidating financial information of the WorldCom group and the
MCI group. The financial information reflects the businesses attributed to the
WorldCom group and the MCI group including the allocation of revenues and
expenses between the WorldCom group and the MCI group in accordance with our
allocation policies.

The attribution of the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses for
each group, as reflected in our interim consolidated financial statements, which
are consolidated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, is primarily based on specific identification of the
businesses included in each group. Where specific identification was
impractical, other methods and criteria were used that our management believes
are equitable and provide a reasonable estimate of the assets, liabilities,
equity, revenues and expenses attributable to each group. Our shared corporate
services and related balance sheet amounts (such as executive management, human
resources, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, treasury, strategic planning and
information systems support) have been attributed to the WorldCom group or the
MCI group based upon identification of such services specifically benefiting
each group. Where determinations based on specific usage alone are impractical,
other methods and criteria were used that our management believes are equitable
and provide a reasonable estimate of the cost attributable to each group.

Our board of directors or any special committee appointed by the board of
directors may, without shareholder approval, change the polices set forth in our
tracking stock policy statement. Our board of directors or any special committee
appointed by the board of directors also may, without shareholder approval,
adopt additional policies or make exceptions with respect to the application of
the policies described in our tracking stock policy statement in connection with
particular facts and circumstances, all as our board of directors or any special
committee appointed by the board of directors may determine to be in our best
interests as a whole.

            WORLDCOM GROUP (AN INTEGRATED BUSINESS OF WORLDCOM, INC.)

                     NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(A) GENERAL

The combined financial statements included herein for the WorldCom group (an
integrated business of WorldCom, Inc.), are unaudited and have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
for interim financial reporting and SEC regulations. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the
opinion of our management, the combined financial statements of the WorldCom
group reflect all adjustments (of a normal and recurring nature) which are
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the interim periods. These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2001. The results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2002 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2002.

(B) EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our consolidated financial statements present basic and diluted earnings per
share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock using the two-class method.
The two-class method is an earnings formula that determines the attributed
earnings per share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock according to
participation rights in undistributed earnings. The combined financial
statements of the WorldCom group do not present earnings per share because
WorldCom group stock is a series of our common stock, and the WorldCom group is
not a legal entity with a capital structure.

(C)  SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Interest paid by the WorldCom group during the three months ended March 31, 2001
and 2002, amounted to $140 million and $109 million, respectively. The WorldCom
group made income tax payments totaling $7 million and received a net refund of
previously paid income taxes totaling $214 million during the three months ended
March 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively. In conjunction with business combinations
attributed to the WorldCom group during the three months ended March 31, 2001
and 2002, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows (in millions):

(E)  SEGMENT INFORMATION

Based on its organizational structure, the WorldCom group operates in two
reportable segments: Commercial voice, data and Internet, and International
operations. The WorldCom group's reportable segments represent business units
that primarily offer similar products and services; however, the business units
are managed separately due to the type and class of customer as well as the
geographic dispersion of their operations. The Commercial voice, data and
Internet segment includes voice, data and other types of domestic communications
services for commercial customers, and Internet services including dedicated
access and web and application hosting services. International operations
provide voice, data, Internet and other similar types of communications services
to customers primarily in Europe and the Asia Pacific region.

Our chief operating decision-maker utilizes revenue information in assessing
performance and making overall operating decisions and resource allocations.
Communications services are generally provided utilizing our fiber optic
networks, which do not make a distinction between the types of services
provided. Profit and loss information is reported only on a combined basis to
our chief operating decision-maker and our board of directors.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same policies as those used by
the WorldCom group in preparing its combined financial statements set forth in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. Information
about the WorldCom group's segments for the three months ended March 31, 2001
and 2002, is as follows (in millions):

(G)  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no
longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. The statement also
includes provisions for the identification of reporting units for purposes of
assessing potential future impairments of goodwill. Upon adoption, we stopped
amortizing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, including goodwill
and tradenames. Additionally, we made no revisions to the assigned useful lives
of intangible assets that continue to be amortized. We are conducting impairment
reviews of all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and we expect to
complete this assessment no later than the second quarter of 2002, in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Based on our preliminary analyses, we
estimate that as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 we will reduce
goodwill by $15 to $20 billion.

Our earnings attributed to the WorldCom group for the three months ended March
31, 2001, adjusted to exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives, is as follows (in millions):

              MCI GROUP (AN INTEGRATED BUSINESS OF WORLDCOM, INC.)

                     NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(A) GENERAL

The combined financial statements included herein for the MCI group (an
integrated business of WorldCom, Inc.), are unaudited and have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
for interim financial reporting and SEC regulations. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the
opinion of our management, the combined financial statements of the MCI group
reflect all adjustments (of a normal and recurring nature) which are necessary
to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the interim periods. These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2001. The results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2002 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2002.

(B)  EARNINGS PER SHARE

Our consolidated financial statements present basic and diluted earnings per
share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock using the two-class method.
The two-class method is an earnings formula that determines the attributed
earnings per share for WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock according to
participation rights in undistributed earnings. The combined financial
statements of the MCI group do not present earnings (loss) per share because MCI
group stock is a series of our common stock, and the MCI group is not a legal
entity with a capital structure.

(C)  SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Interest paid by the MCI group during the three months ended March 31, 2001 and
2002, amounted to $122 million and $111 million, respectively. Income taxes
paid, net of refunds received, during the three months ended March 31, 2001
totaled $6 million. No income taxes were paid during the three months ended
March 31, 2002.

(D) SEGMENT INFORMATION

Based on its organizational structure, the MCI group operates in four reportable
segments: Consumer; Wholesale; Alternative channels and small business; and
Dial-up Internet. The MCI group's reportable segments represent business units
that primarily offer similar products and services; however, the business units
are managed separately due to the type and class of customer as well as the
geographic dispersion of their operations. Consumer includes domestic voice
communications services for consumer customers. Wholesale includes domestic long
distance voice and data communications services for wholesale customers.
Alternative channels and small business includes domestic long distance voice
and data, agents, prepaid calling cards and paging services provided to
alternative wholesale and small business customers. Dial-up Internet includes
dial-up Internet access services.

Our chief operating decision-maker utilizes revenue information in assessing
performance and making overall operating decisions and resource allocations.
Communications services are generally provided utilizing our network facilities,
which do not make a distinction between the types of services provided. Profit
and loss information is reported only on a combined basis to our chief operating
decision-maker and our board of directors.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same policies as those used by
the MCI group in preparing its combined financial statements set forth in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. Information
about the MCI group's segments for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and
2002, is as follows (in millions):

(E) CONTINGENCIES

The MCI group's shareholders are subject to all of the risks related to an
investment in WorldCom and the MCI group, including the effects of any legal
proceedings and claims against the WorldCom group. See Note F to our interim
consolidated financial statements for information related to our contingencies.

(F) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no
longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. The statement also
includes provisions for the identification of reporting units for purposes of
assessing potential future impairments of goodwill. Upon adoption, we stopped
amortizing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, including goodwill
and tradenames. Additionally, we made no revisions to the assigned useful lives
of intangible assets that continue to be amortized. We are conducting impairment
reviews of all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and we expect to
complete this assessment no later than the second quarter of 2002, in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Based on our preliminary analyses, we
estimate that as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 we will reduce
goodwill by $15 to $20 billion.

Our earnings attributed to the MCI group for the three months ended March 31,
2001, adjusted to exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives, is as follows (in millions):

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Our common stock consists of two separately traded tracking stocks: WorldCom
group stock, which is intended to reflect the performance of our data, Internet,
international and commercial voice businesses; and MCI group stock, which is
intended to reflect the performance of our consumer, small business, wholesale
long distance voice and data, wireless messaging and dial-up Internet access
businesses.

Through the businesses that we have aligned as the WorldCom group, which have an
extensive, advanced facilities-based global communications network, we provide a
broad range of integrated communications and managed network services to both
U.S. and non-U.S. based corporations. Offerings include data services such as
frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode and Internet protocol networks; Internet
related services, including dedicated access, virtual private networks, digital
subscriber lines, web centers encompassing application and server hosting and
managed data services; commercial voice services; and international
communications services.

Through the businesses that we have aligned as the MCI group, we provide a broad
range of retail and wholesale communications services, including long distance
voice and data communications, consumer local voice communications, wireless
messaging, private line services and dial-up Internet access services. Our
retail services are provided to consumers and small businesses in the United
States. We are the second largest carrier of long distance telecommunications
services in the United States. Our services include: basic long distance
telephone service, dial around, collect calling, operator assistance and calling
card services (including prepaid calling cards) and toll free or 800 services.
We offer these services individually and in combinations. Through combined
offerings, we provide customers with benefits such as single billing, unified
services for multi-location companies and customized calling plans. Our
wholesale businesses include wholesale voice and data services provided to
carrier customers and other resellers and dial-up Internet access services.

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION RELATED TO THE WORLDCOM GROUP AND THE MCI GROUP FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Each of the WorldCom group and the MCI group includes the results of operations
shown in the combined statements of operations and the attributed assets and
liabilities shown in the combined balance sheets of the relevant group. If we
acquire interests in other businesses, we intend to attribute those assets and
any related liabilities to our WorldCom group or our MCI group in accordance
with our tracking stock policy statement. All net income and cash flows
generated by the assets will be attributed to the group to which the assets were
attributed and all net proceeds from any disposition of these assets will also
be attributed to that group.


                                       30
<Page>

Although we sometimes refer to such assets and liabilities as those of the
WorldCom group or the MCI group, neither of the groups is a separate legal
entity. Rather, all of the assets of a group are owned by WorldCom and holders
of the WorldCom group stock or the MCI group stock are shareholders of WorldCom
and subject to all of the risks of an investment in WorldCom and all of its
businesses, assets and liabilities.

We intend, for so long as the WorldCom group stock and the MCI group stock
remains outstanding, to include in filings by WorldCom under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the combined financial statements of each of
the WorldCom group and the MCI group. These combined financial statements will
be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, and in the case of annual financial statements, will be audited.
These combined financial statements are not legally required under current law
or SEC regulations.

Our board of directors or any special committee appointed by our board of
directors may, without shareholder approval, change the policies set forth in
our tracking stock policy statement. Our board of directors or any special
committee appointed by our board of directors also may, without shareholder
approval, adopt additional policies or make exceptions with respect to the
application of the policies described in our policy statement in connection with
particular facts and circumstances, all as they may determine to be in the best
interests of WorldCom. Our board is subject to fiduciary duties to all of
WorldCom's shareholders as one group, not to the holders of any series of stock
separately. Any changes or exceptions will be made after a determination by our
board of what is in the best interests of WorldCom as a whole, which may be
detrimental to the interests of the holders of one series of stock. The ability
to make these changes may make it difficult to address the future of a group
based on the group's past performance.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date thereof.

situation may change in the future.

The following discussion and analysis relates to our financial condition and
results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002. This
information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto contained herein, and the combined financial
statements and notes thereto of each of the WorldCom group and the MCI group
contained herein.

Commercial services revenues, which include the revenues generated from
commercial voice, data, international and Internet services, for the first
quarter of 2002 were $5.1 billion versus $5.2 billion for the first quarter of
2001. The decrease reflects the current economic conditions as well as continued
overall price compression in the marketplace.

Voice revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased 12.1% over the prior year
period and traffic decreased 2.5%. Price compression for long distance business
voice services drove this decline while wireless and local voice services
reflected a modest increase of 4.0% to $482 million. Price compression on voice
revenues is expected to continue for the near term, which will negatively affect
revenue growth in this area.

Data revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased 4.0% over the prior year
period. The decrease was driven by customer data network reductions resulting
from economic restraints which caused many companies to not only reduce their
capital spending but to also reduce their network requirements or groom their
network into more cost effective alternatives. While we continue to add new
sales to our customer base, the customer downsizing noted above outpaced new
sales in the first quarter of 2002. Data includes both commercial long distance
and local dedicated bandwidth sales.

International revenues for the first quarter of 2002 increased 14.2% to $811
million versus $710 million, for the first quarter of 2001. Geographically,
Europe grew 18.3% and Asia Pacific and other areas grew 6.6% for the first
quarter of 2002. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency
fluctuations that had the effect of reducing revenues by approximately $22
million in the first quarter of 2002. Our international business continues to
experience significant price pressure on its products as we continue to
penetrate the retail markets and wholesale continues to represent a large
portion of international revenues.

Internet revenues for the first quarter of 2002 increased 8.9% over the prior
year period. The increase included $34 million of Digex revenues, after
intercompany eliminations, as a result of our merger with Intermedia in July
2001. While less of an impact than data, customer network grooming on
Internet networks partially offset new customer growth in the first quarter
of 2002. Our Internet protocol virtual private network product, or IP-VPN,
continued to show improvement during the first quarter of 2002. This new
product has grown to approximately $120 million in annualized revenue. We
have recently signed several large customer contracts for IP-VPN services and
these customers, combined with overall market acceptance of this product,
should continue to drive growth in this product. Despite this, IP-VPNs have
not yet achieved a size or scale to overcome the attrition on our remote
access product. Our legacy x.25 remote access product is supported by more
mature technologies and our customers are migrating their services to more
cost effective alternatives, such as IP-VPN. Excluding the revenues from the
legacy x.25 product, Internet revenues grew 25%. Internet revenues include
dedicated Internet access, managed networking services and applications (such
as virtual private networks), web hosting and electronic commerce and
transaction services (such as web centers and credit card transaction
processing).

Consumer revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased 11.7% over the prior
year period. The majority of this decrease is attributed to decreases in calling
card, dial around and dial-1 revenues as a result of consumers' continued
substitution of wire line services with wireless and e-mail. Our consumer local
initiatives continue to perform well as consumer local revenues increased over
108% for the first quarter of 2002. In an effort to align our product offerings
with consumer needs and increase our marketshare, we launched The Neighborhood
built by MCIsm in the second quarter of 2002. The Neighborhood is a new
nationwide telecommunications business which unifies local and long


                                       33
<Page>

distance services. The Neighborhood is currently available in 32 states and is
expected to eventually reach more than 50 million households. The brand's
flagship offering, Neighborhood Complete, provides unlimited calling within the
U.S., whether across the street or across the country. It also provides a
complete suite of calling and messaging features from one company, on one bill
for one fixed monthly price. We believe that The Neighborhood will attract
incremental revenue from existing customers as well as new revenues from new
customers. While this product is in its early marketing stages, we believe we
will begin to see the benefits from The Neighborhood as early as the second half
of 2002.

Wholesale revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased 16.0% over the prior
year period. The wholesale market continues to be extremely price competitive,
although the average rate per minute has been relatively stable since the second
quarter of 2001.

Alternative channels and small business revenues for the three months ended
March 31, 2002 decreased 24.5% over the prior year period. Alternative channels
and small business includes sales agents and affiliates, wholesale alternative
channels, small business, prepaid calling card and wireless messaging revenues.
The decrease is attributed to pricing pressures in the wholesale alternative
channels and small business markets which negatively affected revenue growth and
gross margins in this area.

Dial-up Internet revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2002 decreased
20.5% over the prior year amount. Our dial access network has grown 7.5% to
approximately 3.2 million modems as of March 31, 2002, compared with the prior
year period. However, Internet connect hours decreased 7.2% to 1.8 billion hours
for the first quarter of 2002 versus the prior year period. The decrease in
dial-up Internet revenues is attributed to pricing pressure resulting from the
impact of volume discounts and off-net traffic, which lowered average revenue
per hour by approximately 14% for the first quarter of 2002 versus the prior
year period.

LINE COSTS. For the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, our line costs
were as follows (dollars in millions):

                              =======       =======     =======       =======
</Table>

Line costs as a percentage of revenues for the first quarter of 2002 increased
to 42.8% as compared to 41.9% for the first quarter of 2001. The increase as a
percentage of revenues is a direct result of the pricing pressure in most of our
business segments without adequate volume offsets. Additionally, line costs as a
percentage of revenues have increased as a result of the decrease in higher
margin calling card and dial around revenues due to wireless substitution as
noted above.

The principal components of line costs are access charges and transport charges.
Regulators have historically permitted access charges to be set at levels that
are well above traditional phone companies' costs. As a result, access charges
have been a source of universal service subsidies that enable local exchange
rates to be set at levels that are affordable. We have actively participated in
a variety of state and federal regulatory proceedings with the goal of bringing
access charges to cost-based levels and to fund universal service using explicit
subsidies funded in a competitively neutral manner. We cannot predict the
outcome of these proceedings or whether or not the results will have a material
adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
However, our goal is to manage transport costs through utilization of our
networks, favorable contracts with carriers and network efficiencies.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. For the three months ended March
31, 2001 and 2002, our selling, general and administrative expenses were as
follows (dollars in millions):

</Table>

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2002 were
$2.5 billion or 30.5% of revenues as compared to $2.6 billion or 29.4% of
revenues for the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses
for the three months ended March 31, 2001 include pre-tax costs of $125 million
associated with domestic severance packages and other costs related to our
February 2001 workforce reductions ($77 million allocated to the WorldCom group
and $48 million allocated to the MCI group). Excluding these charges in 2001,
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues would
have been 28.0% for the first quarter of 2001.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage
of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2002 is primarily the result
of increased selling, general and administrative expenses associated with our
wireless resale unit. At the end of the first quarter of 2002 we initiated
actions to reduce costs in reaction to the decline in revenues we experienced
in the first quarter of 2002. These actions include our recently announced
workforce reductions. We plan to continue to take steps to reduce our
selling, general and administrative expenses in response to the pricing
pressure on our products, which we believe should help to stabilize selling,
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues during the
second half of 2002.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. For the three months ended March 31, 2001 and
2002, our depreciation and amortization expense was as follows (dollars in
millions):

                                    ======     ======   ======     ======
</Table>

Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2002 decreased to
$1.32 billion or 16.3% of revenues from $1.34 billion or 15.1% of revenues for
the first quarter of 2001. Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter
of 2002 reflects our discontinued amortization of intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, in accordance with SFAS No. 142. For the first quarter
of 2001, depreciation and amortization expense was $1.01 billion excluding the
amortization of indefinite-lived intangibles no longer amortized under SFAS No.
142. On a comparable basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased as a
result of increased depreciation associated with 2000 and 2001 capital
expenditures as well as increased depreciation associated with the assets
acquired in our merger with Intermedia.

INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for the first quarter of 2002 was $447
million or 5.5% of revenues as compared to $305 million or 3.5% of revenues
for the first quarter of 2001. For the three months ended March 31, 2001 and
2002, weighted-average annual interest rates on our long-term debt were 7.13%
and 7.44%, respectively, while weighted-average levels of borrowings were
$24.9 billion and $30.2 billion, respectively. Interest expense for the three
months ended March 31, 2002 increased as a result of higher debt levels and
$3.0 billion of debt obligations acquired in the Intermedia merger.

Capitalized interest for the first quarter of 2002 was $102 million, versus $128
million in the prior year period. The decrease is a result of lower capital and
construction expenditures. For 2002, we expect capitalized interest to continue
to decline $10-$15 million each quarter.


                                       35

MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSE. Miscellaneous expense for the first quarter of
2002 was $156 million or 1.9% of revenues compared to miscellaneous income of
$100 million or 1.1% of revenues for the first quarter of 2001. Miscellaneous
income includes investment income, equity in income and losses of affiliated
companies, the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates for transactions
denominated in foreign currencies, gains and losses on the sale of assets and
other non-operating items. Miscellaneous expense for the first quarter of 2002
includes pre-tax charges of $141 million associated with the disposition of
investments, including the News Corporation sale.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The effective income tax rate of 35.8% of income
before taxes for the first quarter of 2002 is less than the 38.5% effective
income tax rate in the first quarter of 2001 primarily due to our discontinued
amortization of goodwill in 2002.

NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. For the three months ended March
31, 2002, we reported net income applicable to common shareholders of $130
million as compared to $594 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001.

ATTRIBUTION AND ALLOCATION OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES BETWEEN
THE WORLDCOM GROUP AND THE MCI GROUP

The following is a discussion of the methods used to attribute and allocate
property and equipment, revenues, line costs, shared corporate services,
intangible assets and financing arrangements to the WorldCom group and the MCI
group. These methods have been consistently applied for all periods presented.
Additionally, our management believes that the cost allocations outlined below
are equitable and provide a reasonable estimate of the costs attributable to
each group.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment was attributed to the WorldCom
group and the MCI group based on specific identification consistent with the
assets necessary to support the continuing operations of the businesses
attributed to the respective groups. The balances of property and equipment
attributed to each of the groups as of March 31, 2002 are as follows:

REVENUES. Revenues have been attributed to the WorldCom group and the MCI group
based on specific identification of the lines of business that are attributed to
the two groups.

LINE COSTS. Allocated line costs and related liabilities include the costs of
the fiber optic systems attributed to the WorldCom group and the costs of the
business voice switched services attributed to the MCI group. Line costs have
been attributed to the WorldCom group and the MCI group predominantly based on
specific identification of network usage by that group. Where determinations
based on specific usage alone were impractical, we used other allocation
methods, including methods based on the total revenues generated by each group.

SHARED CORPORATE SERVICES. A portion of our shared corporate services and
related balance sheet amounts (such as executive management, human resources,
legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, treasury, strategic planning and information
systems support) has been attributed to the WorldCom group or the MCI group
based upon identification of such services specifically benefiting such group.
Where determinations based on specific usage alone have been impractical, we
used other allocation methods that we believe are fair, including methods based
on such factors as the number of employees and total line costs or revenues
generated by each group.


                                       36

ALLOCATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets include the excess
consideration paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired by us in
business combinations accounted for under the purchase method and include
goodwill, channel rights, developed technology and tradenames. These assets have
been attributed to the respective groups based on specific identification and
where acquired companies have been divided between the WorldCom group and the
MCI group, the intangible assets have been allocated based on the respective
fair values at the date of purchase of the related operations attributed to each
group. Our management believes that this method of allocation is equitable and
provides a reasonable estimate of the intangible assets attributable to the
WorldCom group and the MCI group.

All tradenames, including the MCI tradename and the other related MCI
tradenames, have been attributed to the WorldCom group. Prior to 2002, the MCI
group was allocated an expense of $27.5 million per annum, and the WorldCom
group was allocated a corresponding decrease in depreciation and amortization
expense, for the use of the MCI tradenames. Beginning January 1, 2002, we
stopped amortizing intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, including
goodwill and tradenames, in accordance with SFAS No. 142. We therefore
discontinued the allocation of this expense to the MCI group.

Goodwill and other intangibles assigned or allocated to the WorldCom group and
the MCI group as of March 31, 2002 are as follows:

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. As of January 1, 2001, $6.0 billion of our outstanding
debt was notionally allocated to the MCI group and the remainder of our debt was
notionally allocated to the WorldCom group. Our debt was allocated between the
WorldCom group and the MCI group based upon a number of factors including
estimated future cash flows and the ability to pay debt service and dividends of
each of the groups. In addition, we considered certain measures of
creditworthiness, such as coverage ratios and various tests of liquidity, in the
allocation process. Our management believes that the initial allocation was
equitable and supportable by both the WorldCom group and the MCI group. The debt
allocated to the MCI group bears interest at a rate indicative of the rate at
which the MCI group would borrow from third parties if it was a wholly owned
subsidiary of WorldCom but did not have the benefit of any guarantee by
WorldCom. Interest rates are calculated on a quarterly basis. Debt allocated to
the MCI group bears an interest rate equal to the weighted-average interest
rate, excluding capitalized interest, of WorldCom debt plus 1 1/4 percent.
Interest allocated to the WorldCom group reflects the difference between our
actual interest expense and the interest expense charged to the MCI group. Each
group's allocated debt increases or decreases by the amount of any net cash
generated by, or required to fund, the group's operating activities, investing
activities, dividend payments, share repurchases and other financing activities.

As of March 31, 2002, our receivables purchase program consisted of a $4.0
billion pool of receivables in which the purchaser had an undivided interest
including $2.0 billion sold. The WorldCom group was allocated $2.7 billion of
the pool and $1.7 billion of the sold receivables. The MCI group was allocated
the balance. The receivables sold were assigned based on specific identification
where practical, or allocated based on total revenues. Our management believes
that this method of allocation is equitable and provides a reasonable estimate
of the receivables attributable to the groups.

</Table>

WorldCom group revenues for the first quarter of 2002 were $5.1 billion versus
$5.2 billion for the first quarter of 2001. The decrease reflects the current
economic conditions as well as continued overall price compression in the
marketplace.

Voice revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased 12.1% over the prior year
period and traffic decreased 2.5%. Price compression for long distance business
voice services drove this decline while wireless and local voice services
reflected a modest increase of 4.0% to $482 million. Price compression on voice
revenues is expected to continue for the near term, which will negatively affect
revenue growth in this area.

Data revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased 4.0% over the prior year
period. The decrease was driven by customer data network reductions resulting
from economic restraints which caused many companies to not only reduce their
capital spending but to also reduce their network requirements or groom their
network into more cost effective alternatives. While we continue to add new
sales to our customer base, the customer downsizing noted above outpaced new
sales in the first quarter of 2002. Data includes both commercial long distance
and local dedicated bandwidth sales.

International revenues for the first quarter of 2002 increased 14.2% to $811
million versus $710 million, for the first quarter of 2001. Geographically,
Europe grew 18.3% and Asia Pacific and other areas grew 6.6% for the first
quarter of 2002. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency
fluctuations that had the effect of reducing revenues by approximately $22
million in the first quarter of 2002. Our international business continues to
experience significant price pressure on its products as we continue to
penetrate the retail markets and wholesale continues to represent a large
portion of international revenues.


                                       38

Internet revenues for the first quarter of 2002 increased 8.9% over the prior
year period. The increase included $34 million of Digex revenues, after
intercompany eliminations, as a result of our merger with Intermedia in July
2001. While less of an impact than data, customer network grooming on
Internet networks partially offset new customer growth in the first quarter
of 2002. Our Internet protocol virtual private network product, or IP-VPN,
continued to show improvement during the first quarter of 2002. This new
product has grown to approximately $120 million in annualized revenues. We
have recently signed several large customer contracts for IP-VPN services and
these customers, combined with overall market acceptance of this product,
should continue to drive growth in this product. Despite this, IP-VPNs have
not yet achieved a size or scale to overcome the attrition on our remote
access product. Our legacy x.25 remote access product is supported by more
mature technologies and our customers are migrating their services to more
cost effective alternatives, such as IP-VPN. Excluding the revenues from the
legacy x.25 product, Internet revenues grew 25%. Internet revenues include
dedicated Internet access, managed networking services and applications (such
as virtual private networks), web hosting and electronic commerce and
transaction services (such as web centers and credit card transaction
processing).

LINE COSTS. Line costs as a percentage of revenues for the first quarter of 2002
increased to 39.8% as compared to 38.2% reported for the first quarter of 2001.
The increase as a percentage of revenues is a direct result of the pricing
pressure in the data, international and Internet markets without adequate volume
offsets.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. Selling, general and administrative
expenses for the first quarter of 2002 were $1.3 billion or 25.5% of revenues as
compared to $1.3 billion or 25.9% of revenues for the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2001
include pre-tax costs of $77 million associated with domestic severance packages
and other costs related to our February 2001 workforce reductions. Excluding
these charges in 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenues would have been 24.4% for the first quarter of 2001.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily the
result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses associated
with our wireless resale unit. At the end of the first quarter of 2002 we
initiated actions to reduce costs in reaction to the decline in revenues we
experienced in the first quarter of 2002. These actions include our recently
announced workforce reductions. We plan to continue to take steps to reduce
our selling, general and administrative expenses in response to the pricing
pressure on our products, which we believe should help to stabilize selling,
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues during the
second half of 2002.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization expense for the
first quarter of 2002 increased to $956 million or 18.8% of revenues from $901
million or 17.3% of revenues for the prior year period. Depreciation and
amortization for the first quarter of 2002 reflects the WorldCom group's
discontinued amortization of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, in
accordance with SFAS No. 142. For the first quarter of 2001, depreciation and
amortization expense was $650 million excluding the amortization of
indefinite-lived intangibles no longer amortized under SFAS No. 142. On a
comparable basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of
additional depreciation associated with 2000 and 2001 capital expenditures and
increased depreciation associated with the assets acquired in our merger with
Intermedia.

INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for the first quarter of 2002 was $327
million or 6.4% of revenues as compared to $179 million or 3.4% of revenues for
the first quarter of 2001. Interest expense on borrowings incurred by WorldCom
and allocated to the WorldCom group reflects the difference between WorldCom's
actual interest expense and the interest expense allocated to the MCI group. The
MCI group is allocated interest based on the weighted-average interest rate,
excluding capitalized interest, of WorldCom debt plus 1 1/4 percent.

Capitalized interest for the first quarter of 2002 was $102 million, versus $128
million in the prior year period. The decrease is a result of lower capital and
construction expenditures. For 2002, we expect capitalized interest to continue
to decline $10-$15 million each quarter.

MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSE. Miscellaneous expense for the first quarter of
2002 was $156 million, or 3.1% of revenues as compared to miscellaneous income
of $100 million, or 1.9% of revenues for the first quarter of 2001.


                                       39
<Page>

Miscellaneous income includes investment income, equity in income and losses of
affiliated companies, the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates for
transactions denominated in foreign currencies, gains and losses on the sale of
assets and other non-operating items. Miscellaneous expense for the first
quarter of 2002 includes pre-tax charges of $141 million associated with the
disposition of investments, including the News Corporation sale.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The effective income tax rate of 36.0% of income
before taxes for the first quarter of 2002 is less than the 38.2% effective
income tax rate in the first quarter of 2001 primarily due to our discontinued
amortization of goodwill in 2002.

NET INCOME. For the three months ended March 31, 2002, the WorldCom group
reported net income of $184 million as compared to $532 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001. Diluted income per WorldCom group share for the
first quarter of 2002 was $0.06 compared to income per WorldCom group share of
$0.18 for the first quarter of 2001. Diluted income per share for the 2001
period assumes the recapitalization occurred at the beginning of 2001 and that
the WorldCom group stock and MCI group stock existed for all periods presented.

Consumer revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased 11.7% over the prior
year period. The majority of this decrease is attributed to decreases in calling
card, dial around and dial-1 revenues as a result of consumers' continued
substitution of wire line services with wireless and e-mail. Our consumer local
initiatives continue to perform well as consumer local revenues increased over
108% for the first quarter of 2002. In an effort to align our product offerings
with consumer needs and increase our market share, we launched The Neighborhood
built by MCIsm in the second quarter of 2002. The Neighborhood is a new
nationwide telecommunications business which unifies local and long distance
services. The Neighborhood is currently available in 32 states and is expected
to eventually reach more than 50


                                       40

million households. The brand's flagship offering, Neighborhood Complete,
provides unlimited calling within the U.S., whether across the street or across
the country. It also provides a complete suite of calling and messaging features
from one company, on one bill for one fixed monthly price. We believe that The
Neighborhood will attract incremental revenue from existing customers as well as
new revenues from new customers. While this product is in its early marketing
stages, we believe we will begin to see the benefits from The Neighborhood as
early as the second half of 2002.

Wholesale revenues for the first quarter of 2002 decreased 16.0% over the prior
year period. The wholesale market continues to be extremely price competitive,
although the average rate per minute has been relatively stable since the second
quarter of 2001.

Alternative channels and small business revenues for the three months ended
March 31, 2002 decreased 24.5% over the prior year period. Alternative channels
and small business includes sales agents and affiliates, wholesale alternative
channels, small business, prepaid calling card and wireless messaging revenues.
The decrease is attributed to pricing pressures in the wholesale alternative
channels and small business markets which negatively affected revenue growth and
gross margins in this area.

Dial-up Internet revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2002 decreased
20.5% over the prior year amount. Our dial access network has grown 7.5% to
approximately 3.2 million modems as of March 31, 2002, compared with the prior
year period. However, Internet connect hours decreased 7.2% to 1.8 billion hours
for the first quarter of 2002 versus the prior year period. The decrease in
dial-up Internet revenues is attributed to pricing pressure resulting from the
impact of volume discounts and off-net traffic, which lowered average revenue
per hour by approximately 14% for the first quarter of 2002 versus the prior
year period.

LINE COSTS. Line costs as a percentage of revenues for the first quarter of 2002
increased to 51.6% as compared to 50.4% reported for the prior year period. This
increase resulted from the continued competitive pricing on the dial-up Internet
business and the decrease in higher margin calling card and dial around revenues
due to wireless substitution as noted above.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. Selling, general and administrative
expenses for the first quarter of 2002 were $1.27 billion or 41.7% of revenues
as compared to $1.34 billion or 36.9% of revenues for the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2001
include $48 million associated with domestic severance packages and other costs
related to our February 2001 workforce reductions. Excluding this, selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 35.6% for
the first quarter of 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of revenues can be attributed to the pricing pressure
on our products as noted above.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization expense for the
first quarter of 2002 decreased to $169 million or 5.6% of revenues from $227
million or 6.3% of revenues for the same period in the prior year. Depreciation
and amortization for the first quarter of 2002 reflects the MCI group's
discontinued amortization of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, in
accordance with SFAS No. 142. For the first quarter of 2001, depreciation and
amortization expense was $154 million excluding the amortization of
indefinite-lived intangibles no longer amortized under SFAS No. 142. On a
comparable basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of
additional depreciation associated with 2000 and 2001 capital expenditures.

INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense for the first quarter of 2002 was $120
million or 3.9% of revenues as compared to $126 million or 3.5% of revenues
for the same period in 2001. Interest expense on borrowings incurred by
WorldCom and allocated to the MCI group is based on the weighted-average
interest rate, excluding capitalized interest, of WorldCom debt plus 1 1/4
percent. As of January 1, 2001, $6.0 billion of WorldCom's outstanding debt
was notionally allocated to the MCI group.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT). The effective income tax rate of 36.5% of loss
before taxes for the first quarter of 2002 is less than the 41.0% effective
income tax rate in the first quarter of 2001 primarily due to our discontinued
amortization of goodwill in 2002.

NET INCOME. For the three months ended March 31, 2002, the MCI group reported
net loss of $54 million as compared to net income of $62 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001. Diluted loss per MCI group share for the first
quarter of 2002 was $0.46 compared to diluted income per MCI group share of
$0.54 for the first quarter of 2001. Diluted income per share assumes the
recapitalization occurred at the beginning of 2001 and that the WorldCom group
stock and MCI group stock existed for all periods presented.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of March 31, 2002, our total debt was $30.2 billion and we had available
liquidity of $10.2 billion under our credit facilities, which are described in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, and from
available cash.

As of January 1, 2001, the MCI group was notionally allocated $6.0 billion of
WorldCom's debt and the remaining outstanding debt was notionally allocated to
the WorldCom group. WorldCom management has a wide degree of discretion over the
cash management policies of both the WorldCom group and the MCI group. Cash
generated by either group can be transferred to the other group without prior
approval of WorldCom's shareholders. Due to the discretion possessed by
management over the cash management policies of both groups, including the
timing and decision of whether to finance capital expenditures, it may be
difficult to assess each group's liquidity and capital resource needs, and, in
turn, the future prospects of each group based on past performance. For the
first quarter of 2002, the MCI group generated sufficient cash to pay $71
million for dividends on MCI group stock and to repay $9 million of its
allocated notional debt.

As of March 31, 2002, we had no amounts drawn against our credit facilities
which include the following:

o     $1.6 billion revolving credit facility that expires June 8, 2006;

o     $2.65 billion 364-day revolving credit facility that expires June 7, 2002
      with a one-year conversion feature; and

o     $3.75 billion revolving credit facility that expires June 30, 2002.

We intend to replace our $2.65 billion 364-day revolving credit facility and
we do not intend to renew the $3.75 billion revolving credit facility.
Additionally, we are working with our banking group to increase the size of
our facilities in exchange for security. These negotiations, if successfully
completed, will result in $5.0 billion or more of availability under credit
facilities which would mature between 2005 - 2006.

We remain on schedule in these negotiations and expect to complete the
process over the next few weeks. It is anticipated that in the interim,
we will draw against the $2.65 billion revolving credit facility in order to
preserve the one-year conversion feature on the facility. However, it is
intended that the amounts drawn under the $2.65 billion revolving credit
facility will be repaid upon completion of the new credit facility agreements.

Our senior debt is currently rated as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>

             Rating Agency                         Rating      Outlook
             -------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                <C>         <C>
             Moody's Investors Service             Ba2         negative
             Standard & Poor's                     BB          negative
             Fitch Ratings                         BB          negative
</Table>

These ratings, or any further downgrade in rating, have not and will not
trigger any defauls on our outstanding bond debt or our undrawn credit
facilities, although our interest rates and our annual commitment fee under
our credit facilities are sensitive to ratings adjustments.

On May 9, 2002, we obtained a waiver on our existing $2.0 billion receivables
purchase program, which eliminates any concerns regarding the effect of
credit ratings on this program during the period covered by the waiver.
Additionally, we are in the process of negotiating the replacement of our
current receivables purchase program with a new $1.5 billion facility that
does not contain any ratings triggers. We expect the new program will be in
place by May 23, 2002, when the current waiver expires on our existing $2.0
billion receivables purchase program. We expect the funds used to reduce the
receivables purchase program down to a $1.5 billion facility will be obtained
from a combination of cash and availability under our credit facilities.

                                       42

In February 2002, we liquidated our remaining investment in News Corporation and
received cash proceeds of $870 million, net of $60 million for sales discounts
and banking fees. Additionally, on April 15, 2002, we elected to redeem our $700
million 6.125% senior notes due 2012. Cash balances were used to repay this
obligation.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

For the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, our cash flows from
operations were as follows (dollars in millions):

</Table>

The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2002 versus the prior year
amount reflects an improved working capital position, which was partially offset
by lower operating results in both the WorldCom group and the MCI group.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

For the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, our net cash used in
investing activities was as follows (dollars in millions):

<Table>

</Table>

The WorldCom group's capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion in the first
three months of 2001 and $1.3 billion in the first three months of 2002. Primary
capital expenditures include purchases of transmission, communications and other
equipment. The MCI group's capital expenditures totaled $95 million in the first
three months of 2001 and $30 million in the first three months of 2002. The MCI
group's capital expenditures include purchases of switching equipment, dial
modems and messaging and other equipment.

Investing activities include intangible asset increases at the WorldCom group of
$106 million for the first quarter of 2001 and $116 million for the first
quarter of 2002, and at the MCI group of $118 million for the first quarter of
2001 and $60 million for the first quarter of 2002. Intangible asset additions
primarily represent costs incurred to develop software for internal use.

Investing activities include acquisitions and related costs at the WorldCom
group of $142 million and $2 million in the first three months of 2001 and 2002,
respectively.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

For the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, cash provided by (used in)
financing activities was as follows (dollars in millions):

<Table>

                                                              2001       2002

     Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities     $1,326     $ (103)
                                                             ======     ======
</Table>

Financing activities include net repayments on debt of $22 million for the first
three months of 2002 and net proceeds from borrowings on debt of $1.3 billion
for the first three months of 2001. Financing activities for the MCI group
reflect the payment of dividends to MCI group shareholders and repayment of
notionally allocated debt from WorldCom.


                                       43
<Page>

Also included in financing activities are proceeds from WorldCom's common stock
issuances of $71 million and $14 million in the first three months of 2001 and
2002, respectively, as a result of WorldCom common stock option and warrant
exercises.

Distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and dividends
paid on preferred stock in the first three months of 2001 and 2002 were $16
million and $24 million, respectively. The increase represents dividends
associated with our Series D, E and F preferred stock which was issued in
connection with the Intermedia merger. Dividends on the Series D, E and F
preferred stock are payable in cash or shares of our common stock, at our
election. To date, we have paid these dividends in cash, however, we expect
that future dividends on the Series D, E and F preferred stock will be paid
in shares of our common stock.

During the first quarter of 2002, we paid a cash dividend of $0.60 per share of
MCI group common stock, or $71 million in the aggregate. Additionally, the
dividends payable during the second and third quarters of 2002 have already been
declared and/or paid.

We anticipate that 2002 capital expenditures for the WorldCom group will be up
to $4.5 billion and will be approximately $400 million (including software
development) at the MCI group. Additionally, we believe that free cash flow
(cash flow from operations less cash flow used in investing activities) will
approximate $1.0 billion in 2002 and will increase each subsequent year by more
than $250 million through at least 2004.

Currently, scheduled debt maturities are $60 million for the remainder of
2002, after our redemption of $700 million of remarketable notes on April 15,
2002, $1.6 billion in 2003, $2.5 billion in 2004 and $2.3 billion in 2005.
Additionally, we have $1.0 billion in dealer remarketable securities which
are subject to mandatory tender in January 2003, and we have $500 million of
bonds with a stated 2027 maturity which have a put feature for June 2003. We
believe that the free cash flow noted above in addition to available cash and
availability under our credit facilities will be more than sufficient to meet
our debt and capital requirements beyond the next twelve months.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated
and combined financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2001. We believe some of our most critical
accounting policies include:

o     estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities associated with
      revenue reserves and provisions for uncollectible accounts and pending
      litigation and regulatory matters;

o     accounting for income taxes;

o     goodwill and intangibles;

o     valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, and goodwill;

o     estimating depreciation and amortization associated with long-lived
      assets; and

o     allocation policies between the WorldCom group and the MCI group.

ESTIMATING VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. The preparation of our
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented.
Specifically, our management must make estimates of future customer credits
through the analysis of historical trends and known events. Significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with
establishing the revenue reserves associated with discounts earned on special
customer agreements, billing reserves for pricing changes and customer disputes.
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue
adjustments if management projections differ from actual results. Similarly, our
management must make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts
receivable. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable including
historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and
current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of


                                       44
<Page>

the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of March 31, 2002, our accounts
receivable balance was $5.0 billion, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of
$1.2 billion.

We have recorded accruals for loss contingencies in our consolidated financial
statements associated with legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental
to our business. Such accruals are based on our management's estimate of the
projected liability and range of loss in accordance with applicable accounting
guidance. Because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of
loss on the remaining pending matters, management is unable to make a reasonable
estimate of the ultimate liability related to an unfavorable outcome. As
additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability
related to our pending matters and revise our estimates. The results of these
various legal and regulatory matters are uncertain and could have a material
adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. As part of the process of preparing our
consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes
in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves our
estimating actual current tax exposure for WorldCom together with assessing
temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as
property, plant and equipment depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes.
Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in
income tax law or results from final tax exam reviews.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES. Purchase accounting requires extensive use of
accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair
market value of the assets and liabilities purchased. In our recording of
acquisitions, we allocate the purchase price among certain identifiable
intangible assets and goodwill based on third party appraisals.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES. We assess the
impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment
review include the following:

o     significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
      future operating results;

o     significant changes in the use of our assets or the strategy for our
      overall business;

o     significant negative industry or economic trends;

o     significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and

o     our market capitalization relative to net book value.

We determine any impairment by comparing the undiscounted future cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets to their respective carrying amounts.
In the event an impairment exists, a loss is recognized based on the amount by
which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or group of assets.
If quoted market prices for an asset are not available, fair market value is
determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on property and equipment to be
disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values
are reduced for the cost to dispose.

As discussed below, SFAS No. 142, became effective on January 1, 2002 and as a
result, we stopped amortizing approximately $45.0 billion of net goodwill and
$1.0 billion of net tradenames. Based on our current levels of such assets, this
will reduce amortization by approximately $1.3 billion annually. In lieu of
amortization, we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our
goodwill and tradenames in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter. We
expect to complete our initial impairment review in the second quarter of 2002.

We currently estimate that we will record an impairment charge upon completion
of the initial impairment review of approximately $15 to $20 billion.


                                       45
<Page>

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. We assign useful lives for
long-lived assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and our
intended use for those assets. Any change in these asset lives would be reported
in our statement of operations as soon as any change in estimate is determined.
There have been no material changes in asset lives during the periods presented.

ALLOCATION POLICIES BETWEEN THE WORLDCOM GROUP AND THE MCI GROUP. The financial
information for the WorldCom group and the MCI group reflect the performance of
the businesses attributed to each group and includes the attribution and
allocation of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses between the
WorldCom group and the MCI group in accordance with our tracking stock policy.
Our management believes that the attribution and allocation methods used are
equitable and provide a reasonable estimate of the costs attributable to each
group. However, it is not practical to determine whether the allocated amounts
represent amounts that would have been incurred on a stand-alone basis. Our
board of directors or any special committee appointed by our board of directors
may, without shareholder approval, change the policies set forth in our tracking
stock policy statement and may adopt additional policies or make exceptions with
respect to the application of the policies described in our policy statement in
connection with particular facts and circumstances, all as they may determine to
be in the best interests of WorldCom. Our board is subject to fiduciary duties
to all of WorldCom's shareholders as one group, not to the holders of any series
of stock separately. These policies are discussed in this management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The information regarding related party transactions is included in Part II,
Item 5, below, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 "Business Combinations" and SFAS No.
142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, which includes the Intermedia
merger, to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens
the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill. Recorded
goodwill and intangibles are evaluated against this new criteria and may result
in certain intangibles being subsumed into goodwill, or alternatively, amounts
initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart
from goodwill. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual
impairment tests. The statement includes provisions for the identification of
reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of
goodwill. Upon adoption, we stopped amortizing intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives, including goodwill and tradenames. Based on current levels of such
assets, this will reduce amortization expense by approximately $1.3 billion
annually ($1.0 billion at WorldCom group and $0.3 billion at MCI group).
Additionally, we are conducting impairment reviews of all intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives and we expect to complete this assessment no later
than the second quarter of 2002, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
142. Based on our preliminary analyses, we estimate that as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No. 142 we will reduce goodwill by $15 to $20 billion.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 "Asset Retirement Obligations," which
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with retiring assets. The fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recorded in the period in which it is incurred,
with the cost capitalized as part of the related long-lived assets and
depreciated over the asset's useful life. Changes in the liability resulting
from the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. SFAS No. 143
must be adopted by 2003. We have not yet quantified the impact of adopting SFAS
No. 143 on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which supersedes both SFAS No. 121
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions for the
disposal of a segment of a business contained in APB Opinion No. 30,
"Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions." SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting model
for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation
of discontinued operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are effective
beginning in 2002 and are not expected to have a material impact on our
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and changes in
market values of our investments.

We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.
We have minimal cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes for our
fixed rate, long-term debt obligations. We do not believe a hypothetical 10%
adverse rate change in our variable rate debt obligations would be material to
our results of operations.

We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk primarily due to our international
operation's holding of approximately $512 million in U.S. dollar denominated
debt, and our holding of approximately $1.8 billion of indebtedness indexed in
other foreign currencies including the Euro and Sterling Pound as of March 31,
2002. Our potential immediate loss that would result from a hypothetical 10%
change in foreign currency exchange rates based on this position would be
approximately $205 million. In addition, if that change were to be sustained,
our cost of financing would increase in proportion to the change.

We are also subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our
international operations which use a foreign currency as their functional
currency and are translated into U.S. dollars.

We believe our market risk exposure with regard to our marketable equity
securities is limited to changes in quoted market prices for the securities.
Based upon the composition of our marketable equity securities at March 31,
2002, we do not believe a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted market
prices would be material to our results of operations or financial position.

        We have entered into certain loan and guaranty arrangements involving
        Bernard J. Ebbers, principally relating to certain obligations to
        financial institutions secured by Mr. Ebbers' stock in WorldCom. We
        initially established these arrangements in 2000, and have agreed to a
        series of modifications since January 1, 2001. On April 29, 2002, in
        connection with Mr. Ebbers' resignation as President, Chief Executive
        Officer and Director of WorldCom, we consolidated these various loan and
        guaranty arrangements into a single promissory note in the principal
        amount of approximately $408.2 million, repayable with accrued interest
        over five years. This principal amount includes approximately $198.7
        million that we have paid to Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America,
        as repayment of outstanding indebtedness of Mr. Ebbers or certain
        companies controlled by him which we had guaranteed, approximately $36.5
        million that we have deposited to collateralize a letter of credit used
        to support financing to an unrelated third party,


                                       47

        approximately $165 million that we have loaned to Mr. Ebbers and all
        interest accrued on the foregoing amounts to April 29, 2002. These
        transactions are further described below.

        Since establishing these arrangements, we agreed to guarantee $150
        million principal amount of indebtedness owed by Mr. Ebbers to Bank of
        America, as well as certain additional payments and related costs. The
        additional payments included, among other things, amounts payable to
        Bank of America by Mr. Ebbers or certain companies controlled by him
        relating to an approximately $45.6 million letter of credit secured by
        a portion of Mr. Ebbers' stock and used to support financing to an
        unrelated third party; specified amounts, including margin debt, that
        became payable following stock price declines; and amounts subject to a
        margin call with respect to certain margin debt.

        The scheduled maturity of the Bank of America margin debt was extended
        in January 2002 for a period of up to two years. However, following
        declines in the closing price of the WorldCom group stock through early
        February 2002, we made aggregate payments of approximately $198.7
        million to repay all of the outstanding debt covered by our guaranty and
        deposited with Bank of America approximately $36.5 million to
        collateralize the letter of credit, which is scheduled to expire on
        February 15, 2003, subject to renewal, extension or substitution. Our
        payments, together with any amounts paid or costs incurred by us in
        connection with the letter of credit, plus accrued interest at a
        floating rate equal to that under one of our credit facilities, were
        payable by Mr. Ebbers to us, as modified in early April 2002, within 90
        days after demand, or within 180 days after demand if subsequent to his
        death or incapacity.

        In addition to the guaranty arrangements, during 2000 we loaned $100
        million to Mr. Ebbers. Since January 1, 2001, we have loaned him
        approximately an additional $65 million, for a total maximum principal
        amount of approximately $165 million. These loans bore interest at
        floating rates equal to that under certain of our credit facilities and,
        as modified in early April 2002, were payable within 90 days after
        demand, or within 180 days after demand if subsequent to Mr. Ebbers'
        death or incapacity.

        As noted above, on April 29, 2002, Mr. Ebbers' obligations to WorldCom
        under these loans and guaranty arrangements were consolidated into a
        single promissory note, which replaced the former notes. As of May 14,
        2002, the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness owed by Mr. Ebbers
        to us under this note was approximately $408.2 million, which
        constitutes the largest aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding
        since January 1, 2001. The principal amount is subject to payment
        over five years on the following schedule: $25 million on April 29,
        2003, $25 million on April 29, 2004, $75 million on April 29, 2005,
        $100 million on April 29, 2006, and all remaining principal on April
        29, 2007. Mr. Ebbers is also obligated to pay interest on the
        outstanding balance, compounded monthly, on each repayment date at a
        fluctuating interest rate equal to that under one of our credit
        facilities, which was 2.32% per annum as of April 29, 2002. All
        principal and accrued interest under this note are immediately due
        and payable (1) upon the death of Mr. Ebbers, or (2) upon demand in
        the case of certain events of default, or (3) automatically without
        notice in the case of certain events of bankruptcy by or against
        Mr. Ebbers.

        We have been advised that Mr. Ebbers has used the proceeds of the loans
        from us principally to repay certain indebtedness under loans secured by
        shares of our stock owned by him and that the proceeds of such secured
        loans were used for private business purposes. The loans and guaranty
        arrangements by us were made following a determination that they were in
        the best interests of WorldCom and our shareholders in order to avoid
        additional forced sales of Mr. Ebbers' stock in WorldCom. The
        determination was made by our compensation and stock option committee as
        a result of the pressure on our stock price, margin calls faced by Mr.
        Ebbers and other considerations. Such actions by our compensation and
        stock option committee were ratified and approved by our board of
        directors.

        In connection with the transactions described above and, as to a portion
        of the shares, subject to certain limitations and effective upon
        termination of restrictions under existing lending agreements, Mr.
        Ebbers pledged to us the shares of our stock currently owned by him or
        later acquired upon option exercise with respect to his obligations
        under the loans and guaranty arrangements from us. This pledge has been
        perfected as to 9,287,277 shares of WorldCom group stock and 575,149
        shares of MCI group stock. The pledge of the remaining shares of
        WorldCom and MCI group stock owned by Mr. Ebbers will


                                       48
<Page>

        take effect as and to the extent the limitations and restrictions under
        existing lending arrangements terminate. Following recent margin sales
        in respect of his shares, Mr. Ebbers' remaining holdings consist of
        an additional 5,091,483 shares of WorldCom group stock and no shares of
        MCI group stock. In addition, Mr. Ebbers has pledged to us security
        interests in certain equity interests in privately held businesses
        owned by him. Mr. Ebbers also agreed to indemnify us for any amounts
        expended or losses, damages, costs, claims or expenses incurred under
        the guaranty arrangements or the loans from us.

        Mr. Ebbers has also entered into a separation agreement with us as of
        April 29, 2002, which provides that he resigned from all directorships,
        offices and positions with us, and that he would be appointed to serve
        our board of directors as non-executive CHAIRMAN EMERITUS at the
        pleasure of the board. The agreement further provides that Mr. Ebbers
        will remain available for a period of five years to provide consulting
        services to us from time to time. The agreement also provides that we
        will pay an annual pension of $1.5 million to Mr. Ebbers for the
        remainder of his life, and an annual pension benefit of $750,000 to his
        current spouse for the remainder of her life, should she survive him, as
        well as continued medical and life insurance benefits for Mr. Ebbers'
        lifetime at our expense, limited use of our aircraft and the right to
        lease office space from us. The agreement further provides that all of
        Mr. Ebbers' outstanding options to purchase WorldCom group stock or MCI
        group stock became fully vested and exercisable as of April 29, 2002,
        and will generally remain exercisable for a period of five years
        following that date (or, if earlier, the expiration of the original
        term). As of that date, Mr. Ebbers held unvested options to acquire
        1,788,627 shares of WorldCom group stock at a weighted-average exercise
        price of $30.90 per share and vested options to acquire 9,510,678 shares
        of WorldCom group stock at a weighted- average exercise price of $21.25
        per share. Mr. Ebbers does not hold any outstanding options to acquire
        MCI group stock. Under the agreement, Mr. Ebbers also is subject to a
        number of restrictive covenants, including a five-year non-competition
        covenant in favor of us and our affiliates. Mr. Ebbers and we also
        agreed to a mutual release of actual or potential claims, subject to
        certain exceptions. Finally, in the event of any breach of the agreement
        or default by Mr. Ebbers in any of his obligations under the promissory
        note and related arrangements or the filing of bankruptcy by him, the
        payment of pension benefits described above will be permanently
        discontinued and all outstanding amounts due to us by him will be
        accelerated as provided in the promissory note.

        Effective with Mr. Ebbers' resignation, John W. Sidgmore, previously
        Vice Chairman of WorldCom, was appointed President and CEO of WorldCom
        and Bert C. Roberts has remained Chairman of our board of directors.
        Additionally, Scott D. Sullivan has been made Executive Vice President
        and Chief Financial Officer, and Ronald R. Beaumont has been made Chief
        Operating Officer of WorldCom, overseeing operations for both the
        WorldCom group and the MCI group.
