AEROSONIC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

JULY 31, 2001

NOTE A - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
------------------------------

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim
financial reporting and with the instructions to form 10-Q of regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
Operating results for the three- and six-month periods ended July 31, 2001 are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ended January 31, 2002. For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's annual
report on form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2001.

NOTE B - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
------------------------------

As reported in the annual report on form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January
31, 2001, in accordance with a consent agreement signed by the Company in 1993,
the Company's environmental consultant has developed an interim remedial action
plan to contain and remediate certain contamination on and underlying the
Company's property. During 1997 the Company recorded a provision of
approximately $175,000 related to the estimated costs to be incurred under this
plan. As of January 31, 2000 the company had utilized all amounts originally
recorded in Other accrued expenses, and phase-one remediation had been
completed.

During the third quarter of 2001, management assessed the post-remediation
monitoring expense related to the environmental cleanup of 1993 would cost
approximately $125,000. This amount was accrued and expensed during the third
quarter of FY 2001. Approximately $26,000 remains accrued in Other accrued
expenses at July 31, 2001. Management believes that any additional liability for
any further remediation will not have a material affect on the financial
position of the company.

PART 1.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION
------------------------------

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT
OF OPERATIONS

Company wide net sales for the second quarter ended July 31, 2001 were
$7,431,000 as compared to $5,632,000 for the same period in the preceding year.
Year-to-date net sales for the period ended July 31, 2001 were $13,953,000 as
compared to $12,116,000 in the prior year period. Gross profit as a percentage
of net sales equaled 39% in the second quarter of FY2002 versus 35% during the
same period in the prior year. Gross profit margin, year-to-date, through the
period ended July 31, 2001 equaled 37% versus 33% during the prior year period.
The increase in sales and gross profit margin are primarily the result of an
increased focus on sales of higher margin products.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses increased during the second
quarter ended July 31, 2001 to $2,160,000 as compared to $1,620,000 during the
same period in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales SG&A remained
stable at 29% as compared to the prior year period. SG & A year-to-date through
the period ended July 31, 2001 increased to $4,036,000 from $3,462,000 in the
prior year period. However, as a percentage of net sales, SG & A remained
constant at 29% of net sales from period to period. The increase in costs
represents the additional effort by management to grow the Company's sales while
controlling other SG&A costs.

Interest expense dropped to $86,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2001
from $113,000 during the same period in the preceding year. Interest expense
year-to-date through the period ended July 31, 2001 dropped to $228,000 versus
$231,000 during the prior year period. This reduction is due primarily to
reduced outstanding debt and lower interest rates.

For the second quarter ended July 31, 2001 the Company recorded a net profit of
$376,000 or $0.10 per share, compared to a net profit of $120,000, or $0.03 per
share during the same period in the preceding year. Earnings year-to-date
through the period ended July 31, 2001 increased to $556,000, or $0.14 per share
from $211,000, or $0.05 per share.

Working capital equaled $12,764,000 at July 31, 2001 and the Company's current
ratio approximated 3.92:1. Cash flow provided by operations was $338,000 through
the second quarter ended July 31, 2001. Company management anticipates that cash
flow from operations, existing cash balances and the availability under the
Company's line of credit arrangement will be sufficient to fund future growth.

The primary market risks exposure for the Company is interest rate risk. The
Company does not currently utilize any financial instruments to manage interest
rate risk.

The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its
variable rate short and long term borrowings. A hypothetical 10% increase in the
Company's weighted average interest rate would have increased the Company's
interest expense for the second quarter by approximately $9,000 based on the
balance of variable rate debt outstanding at July 31, 2001.

     PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION

AEROSONIC CORPORATION

    Item 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     David S. Goldman, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Aerosonic
     Corporation sued the Company in September 1996, for an alleged breach of a
     consulting agreement between Mr. Goldman and the Company. The suit seeks
     damages in excess of $15,000. During fiscal year 1997, the Company sued Mr.
     Goldman and Mil-Spec Finishers, Inc., a former subcontractor to Aerosonic
     Corporation controlled by Mr. Goldman, seeking damages in excess of
     $15,000, for alleged fraud and misappropriation of funds, appropriation of
     corporate opportunity, breach of fiduciary duty and conversion. The Company
     filed an amended complaint, adding claims for civil theft against both
     defendants, in October of 1997. Management believes that the ultimate
     resolution of this matter will not have a material, negative effect on the
     financial position of the Company.
