AEROSONIC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

APRIL 30, 2001

NOTE A - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
------------------------------

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim
financial reporting and with the instructions to form 10-Q of regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
Operating results for the three-month period ended April 30, 2001 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended
January 31, 2002. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial
statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's annual report on form
10-K for the year ended January 31, 2001.

NOTE B - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
------------------------------

As reported in the annual report on form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January
31, 2001, in accordance with a consent agreement signed by the Company in 1993,
the Company's environmental consultant has developed an interim remedial action
plan to contain and remediate certain contamination on and underlying the
Company's property. During 1997 the Company recorded a provision of
approximately $175,000 related to the estimated costs to be incurred under this
plan. As of January 31, 2000 the company had utilized all amounts originally
recorded in Other accrued expenses, and phase-one remediation had been
completed.

During the third quarter of 2001, management assessed the post-remediation
monitoring expense related to the environmental cleanup of 1993 would cost
approximately $125,000. This amount was accrued and expensed during the third
quarter of FY 2001. Approximately $55,000 remains accrued in Other accrued
expenses at April 30, 2001. Management believes that any additional liability
for any further remediation will not have a material affect on the financial
position of the company.

PART 1.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION
------------------------------

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT
OF OPERATIONS

Company wide net sales for the first quarter ended April 30, 2001 were
$6,522,000 as compared to $6,484,000 for the same period in the preceding year.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales equaled 36% in the first quarter of
FY2002 versus 31% during the same period in the prior year. The increase in
sales and gross profit margin are primarily the result of an increased focus on
sales of higher margin products.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses increased during the first
quarter ended April 30, 2001 to $1,876,000 as compared to $1,842,000 during the
same period in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales SG&A
increased slightly to 29% from 28% in the prior year period. The increase in
costs represents the additional effort by management to grow the Company's sales
while controlling other SG&A costs.

Interest expense totaled $142,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2001
versus $118,000 during the same period in the preceding year. The increase is
due primarily to slightly higher interest rates.

For the first quarter ended April 30, 2001 the Company recorded a net profit of
$180,000 or $0.05 per share, compared to a net profit of $91,000, or $0.02 per
share during the same period in the preceding year.

Working capital equaled $12,683,000 at April 30, 2001 and the Company's current
ratio approximated 3.93:1. Negative cash flow from operations during the first
quarter of fiscal year 2002 was due largely to an advance payment to a vendor
related to a new program with the integrated multi-function probe. Company
management anticipates that cash flow from operations, existing cash balances
and the availability under the Company's line of credit arrangement will be
sufficient to fund future growth.

The primary market risks exposure for the Company is interest rate risk. The
Company does not currently utilize any financial instruments to manage interest
rate risk.

The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its
variable rate short and long term borrowings. A hypothetical 10% increase in the
Company's weighted average interest rate would have increased the Company's
interest expense for the first quarter by approximately $12,000 based on the
balance of variable rate debt outstanding at April 30, 2001.

     PART II.        OTHER INFORMATION

AEROSONIC CORPORATION

    Item 1.      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     David S. Goldman, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Aerosonic
     Corporation sued the Company in September 1996, for an alleged breach of a
     consulting agreement between Mr. Goldman and the Company. The suit seeks
     damages in excess of $15,000. During fiscal year 1997, the Company sued Mr.
     Goldman and Mil-Spec Finishers, Inc., a former subcontractor to Aerosonic
     Corporation controlled by Mr. Goldman, seeking damages in excess of
     $15,000, for alleged fraud and misappropriation of funds, appropriation of
     corporate opportunity, breach of fiduciary duty and conversion. The Company
     filed an amended complaint, adding claims for civil theft against both
     defendants, in October of 1997. Management believes that the ultimate
     resolution of this matter will not have a material, negative effect on the
     financial position of the Company.
