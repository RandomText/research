AEROSONIC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

OCTOBER 31, 2001

NOTE A - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
------------------------------

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim
financial reporting and with the instructions to form 10-Q of regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
Operating results for the three- and nine-month periods ended October 31, 2001
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ended January 31, 2002. For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's annual
report on form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2001.

NOTE B - ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
------------------------------

As reported in the annual report on form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January
31, 2001, in accordance with a consent agreement signed by the Company in 1993,
the Company's environmental consultant has developed an interim remedial action
plan to contain and remediate certain contamination on and underlying the
Company's property. During 1997 the Company recorded a provision of
approximately $175,000 related to the estimated costs to be incurred under this
plan. As of January 31, 2000 the company had utilized all amounts originally
recorded in Other accrued expenses, and phase-one remediation had been
completed.

During the third quarter of 2001, management assessed the post-remediation
monitoring expense related to the environmental cleanup of 1993 would cost
approximately $125,000. This amount was accrued and expensed during the third
quarter of Fiscal Year 2001. Approximately $5,000 remains accrued in Other
accrued expenses at October 31, 2001. Management believes that any additional
liability for any further remediation will not have a material affect on the
financial position of the company.

PART 1.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION
------------------------------

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS

Company wide net sales for the third quarter ended October 31, 2001 were
$6,994,000 as compared to $5,706,000 for the same period in the preceding year.
Year-to-date net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2001 were
$20,947,000 as compared to $17,822,000 in the prior year period. Sales increases
were due largely to the increased sales of altimeters, airspeed indicators, non-
warranty instrument repairs, spare parts and riflescope components. Gross profit
as a percentage of net sales equaled 33% in the third quarter of FY2002 versus
36% during the same period in the prior year. Gross profit margin, year-to-date,
through the period ended October 31, 2001 equaled 36% versus 34% during the
prior year period. The decline in gross profit margin in the third quarter was
due to a higher concentration of multi-function probe sales to one certain
customer through Avionics Specialties, Inc., Aerosonic Corporation's wholly -
owned subsidiary.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG & A) expenses decreased during the third
quarter ended October 31, 2001 to $1,895,000 as compared to $2,133,000 during
the same period in the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of net sales SG& A
decreased to 27% as compared to 37% during the prior year period. SG & A
year-to-date through the period ended October 31, 2001 increased to $5,931,000
from $5,595,000 in the prior year period. However, as a percentage of net sales,
SG & A decreased to 28% of net sales compared to 31% during the prior year
period. The decreased SG & A expense during the third quarter ended October 31,
2001 as compared to same period in the prior fiscal year represents a reduction
in legal expenses and the effort by management in controlling other SG & A
costs. Year-to-date SG & A for the nine months ended October 31, 2001 increased
during the year compared to Year to Date prior year due to an increase in legal
expense during the first and second quarters of FY2002.

Interest expense dropped to $99,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2001
from $148,000 during the same period in the preceding year. Interest expense
year-to-date through the period ended October 31, 2001 dropped to $327,000
versus $379,000 during the prior year period. This reduction is due primarily to
reduced outstanding debt and lower interest rates.

For the third quarter ended October 31, 2001 the Company recorded a net profit
of $204,000 or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $193,000, or ($0.05)
per share during the same period in the preceding year. Earnings year-to-date
through the period ended October 31, 2001 increased to $761,000, or $0.19 per
share from $18,000 or $0.00 per share.

Working capital equaled $12,675,000 at October 31, 2001 and the Company's
current ratio approximated 3.70:1. Cash flow provided by operations was $619,000
through the third quarter ended October 31, 2001. Company management anticipates
that cash flow from operations, existing cash balances and the availability
under the Company's line of credit arrangement will be sufficient to fund future
growth.

The primary market risks exposure for the Company is interest rate risk. The
Company does not currently utilize any financial instruments to manage interest
rate risk. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a
result of its variable rate short- and long-term borrowings. A hypothetical 10%
increase in the Company's weighted average interest rate would have increased
the Company's interest expense for the third quarter by approximately $9,000
based on the balance of variable rate debt outstanding at October 31, 2001.

  PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION

AEROSONIC CORPORATION


  Item 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

  David S. Goldman, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Aerosonic
  Corporation sued the Company in September 1996, for an alleged breach of a
  consulting agreement between Mr. Goldman and the Company. The suit seeks
  damages in excess of $15,000. During fiscal year 1997, the Company sued Mr.
  Goldman and Mil-Spec Finishers, Inc., a former subcontractor to Aerosonic
  Corporation controlled by Mr. Goldman, seeking damages in excess of $15,000,
  for alleged fraud and misappropriation of funds, appropriation of corporate
  opportunity, breach of fiduciary duty and conversion. The Company filed an
  amended complaint, adding claims for civil theft against both defendants, in
  October of 1997. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of this
  matter will not have a material, negative effect on the financial position of
  the Company.
